/**
 * RAII Object that attaches a thread to the JVM. Failing to detach from a thread before it
 * exits will cause a crash, as will calling Detach an extra time, and this guard class helps
 * keep that straight. In addition, it remembers whether it performed the attach or not, so it
 * is safe to nest it with itself or with non-fbjni code that manages the attachment correctly.
 *
 * Potential concerns:
 *  - Attaching to the JVM is fast (~100us on MotoG), but ideally you would attach while the
 *    app is not busy.
 *  - Having a thread detach at arbitrary points is not safe in Dalvik; you need to be sure that
 *    there is no Java code on the current stack or you run the risk of a crash like:
 *      ERROR: detaching thread with interp frames (count=18)
 *    (More detail at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/android-ndk/2H8z5grNqjo)
 *    ThreadScope won't do a detach if the thread was already attached before the guard is
 *    instantiated, but there's probably some usage that could trip this up.
 *  - Newly attached C++ threads only get the bootstrap class loader -- i.e. java language
 *    classes, not any of our application's classes. This will be different behavior than threads
 *    that were initiated on the Java side. A workaround is to pass a global reference for a
 *    class or instance to the new thread; this bypasses the need for the class loader.
 *    (See http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jni/spec/invocation.html#attach_current_thread)
 *    If you need access to the application's classes, you can use ThreadScope::WithClassLoader.
 *  - If fbjni has never been initialized, there will be no JavaVM object to attach with.
 *    In that case, a std::runtime_error will be thrown.  This is only likely to happen in a
 *    standalone C++ application, or if Environment::initialize is not used.
