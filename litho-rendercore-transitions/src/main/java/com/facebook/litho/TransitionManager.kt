/**
 * Handles animating transitions defined by ComponentSpec's onCreateTransition code.
 *
 * USAGE FROM MOUNTSTATE
 *
 * Unique per MountState instance. Called from MountState on mount calls to process the transition
 * keys and handles which transitions to run and when.
 *
 * This class is tightly coupled to MountState. When creating new animations, the expected usage of
 * this class is: 1. [.setupTransitions] is called with the current and next [ ]. 2. [.isAnimating]
 * and [.isDisappearing] can be called to determine what is/will be animating 3. MountState updates
 * the mount content for changing content.
 * 4. [.runTransitions] is called to restore initial states for the transition and run the new
 *    animations.
 *
 * Additionally, any time the [MountState] is re-used for a different component tree (e.g. because
 * it was recycled in a RecyclerView), [.reset] should be called to stop running all existing
 * animations.
 *
 * TECHNICAL DETAILS
 * - Transition keys are 1-1 mapped to AnimationState - An [AnimationState] has many [ ]s (one for
 *   each property) - A [PropertyState] can have up to one animation.
 *
 * An [AnimationState] keeps track of the current mount content object, as well as the state of all
 * animating properties ([PropertyState]s). A [PropertyState] keeps track of a
 * [AnimatedPropertyNode], which has the current value of that property in the animation, and up to
 * one animation and end value. A reverse mapping from animation to property(s) being animated is
 * tracked in [.animationsToPropertyHandles].
 *
 * Combined, these mean that at any point in time, we're able to tell what animation is animating
 * what property(s). Knowing this, we can properly resolve conflicting animations (animations on the
 * same property of the same mount content).
 *
 * Another important note: sometimes we need to keep values set on properties before or after
 * animations.
 *
 * Examples include an appearFrom value for an animation that starts later in a sequence of
 * animations (in that case, the appearFrom value must be immediately applied even if the animation
 * isn't starting until later), and keeping disappearTo values even after an animation has completed
 * (e.g., consider animating alpha and X position: if the alpha animation finishes first, we still
 * need to keep the final value until we can remove the animating content).
 *
 * As such, our rule is that we should have a [PropertyState] on the corresponding [ ] for any
 * property that has a value no necessarily reflected by the most up to date [LayoutOutput] for that
 * transition key in the most recent [ ]. Put another way, animation doesn't always imply movement,
 * but a temporary change from a canonical [LayoutOutput].
