## Version 0.37.1

_2020-07-24_

* **Breaking:** Ignore mount calls after `setVisibilityHint(false)` was called on a LithoView until `setVisibilityHint(true)` is called. For more details see the docs about [changing LithoView visibility](https://fblitho.com/docs/visibility-handling).
* New: Add `LithoGestureDetector` wrapper class that ensures gestures are processed on UI thread.

## Version 0.37.0

_2020-07-07_

* **Breaking: `TransparencyEnabledCard` is deprecated** Moved the behavior of `TransparencyEnabledCard` into `Card` when the prop `transparencyEnabled` is `true`. Please migrate your current uses because it will be removed in a few releases.
* New: Add `.duplicateChildrenStates(boolean)` method to `Component` which passes the flag to [`ViewGroup#setAddStatesFromChildren(boolean)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/ViewGroup#setAddStatesFromChildren(boolean)). When this flag is set to true, the component applies all of its children's drawable states (focused, pressed, etc.) to itself.
* New: Ability to specify the percentage of Component's width/height which should be visible to trigger Visible events. Read more in [the documentation](https://fblitho.com/docs/visibility-handling#custom-visibility-percentage).
* Fix: Fix showing vertical scrollbar with `VerticalScrollSpec`. Default behaviour is scrollbars disabled.

For more details, see the [full diff](https://github.com/facebook/litho/compare/v0.36.0...v0.37.0).


## Version 0.36.0

_2020-06-01_

* **Breaking:** Remove unused obsolete `RenderThreadTransition`.
* **Breaking:** Ordering of params in `@ShouldUpdate` callback is fixed (`getNext()`  was previous and `getPrevious()` was next).
* **Breaking:** Rename `ComponentsTestRunner` to `LithoTestRunner`.
* New: Add `TransitionEndEvent` event callback to receive events when a transition ends. Read more about it in [the documentation](https://fblitho.com/docs/transition-choreography#transition-end-callback).
* New: Add `acquireStateHandlerOnRelease` flag for `RecyclerBinder` to opt out of caching `StateHandler`s.
* New: Improved testing APIs: `MountSpecLifecycleTester`, `LifecycleTracker` to track basic lifecycle methods which would replace custom component implementations like `TestDrawable`, `TestComponent`, etc.
* Fix: Ensure `@OnAttached` and `@OnDetached` methods are called in the same order.
* Fix: Remove overriding `isLayoutRequested()` in `SectionsRecyclerView`.
* Fix: Deprecate and ignore `ShouldUpdate#onMount` param. `MountSpec`s with `pureRender` will now always check `shouldUpdate` on the main thread if the information from layout isn't able to be used.
* Fix: Fixup `BackgroundLayoutLooperRule` and improve threading APIs in `ComponentTreeTest`.
* Fix: Fix incorrect key generation after shallow copy.
* Fix: Remove host invalidation suppression during mount.
* Fix: Move setting `PTRRefreshEvent` from `onPrepare` to `onBind` in `RecyclerSpec`.

## Version 0.35.0

_2020-05-01_

* **Experimental: Process Visibility events without Incremental Mount turned on.** If you used Incremental Mount only for Visibility events before, now you can turn it off!
* **Breaking: `LayoutInfo` implementations are required to implement `scrollToPositionWithOffset()`.** To avoid special casing for `LinearLayoutManager` and `StaggeredGridLayoutManager` in `RecyclerBinder` and other internal logic, a LayoutInfo implementation must now delegate to the underlying LayoutManager's scrolling by implementing `scrollToPositionWithOffset()`. Typical cases should call the LayoutManager's own implementation of `scrollToPositionWithOffset()`, or an equivalent. This creates a common interface for programmatic scrolling [a61e409](https://github.com/facebook/litho/commit/a61e409558f82a115d9c21d91c18d5cc8396d385).
* **Breaking: `MeasureListener` now takes two extra parameters**, `layoutVersion` and `stateUpdate`. These are safe to ignore for clients that don't need them. Check [javadoc](https://fblitho.com/javadoc/com/facebook/litho/ComponentTree.MeasureListener.html#onSetRootAndSizeSpec-int-int-int-boolean-) for all the relevant information.
* **Breaking:** Rename `LithoView.performIncrementalMount()` method to `LithoView.notifyVisibleBoundsChanged()`.
* **Breaking:** Rename `getShadowHorizontal()` to `getShadowLeft()` in `CardShadowDrawable`.
* **New:** `@OnCreateInitialState` method in Specs is now guaranteed to be called only once.
* New: Add ability to customize `shadowDx`/`shadowDy` offsets for `CardShadowDrawable` and `CardShadowSpec`.
* New: Add more [Animations](https://github.com/facebook/litho/tree/master/sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/animations/commondynamicprops) [examples](https://github.com/facebook/litho/tree/master/sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/animations/transitions) and Animations [Cookbook](https://github.com/facebook/litho/tree/master/sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/animations/animationcookbook) in the sample app. Check out [docs for more info](https://fblitho.com/docs/dynamic-props#animating-common-dynamic-props).
* New: Update accessibility utils to support newer version of Talkback.
* New: Replace Litho's `MountItem` with RenderCore's and wrap `LayoutOutput` with `RenderTreeNode`.
* New: Litho tests are now migrated to Robolectric 4 and Mockito 2!
* New: New testing utilities: `LithoViewRule`, `LithoStatsRule`, `BackgroundLayoutLooperRule`.
* Fix: Remove 1px white margin between content and shadow for `CardSpec` [00f2bdb](https://github.com/facebook/litho/commit/00f2bdb852a7e0ded29494b909f0c65d1c7c7dc8).
* Fix: Fix Sections not updating layout for sticky items with indices outside range ratio.
* Fix: Fix `RecyclerSpec` not respecting RTL for padding.
* Fix: Add missing `@Nullable` to every method accepting `EventHandler`.
* Fix: Propagate class-level annotations from `SectionSpec`s class to generated Section class.
* Fix: Don't crash on missing `@OnCreateMountContent` method for `MountSpec`s during code generation.
* Fix: Don't crash when comparing `ComparableGradientDrawable`s on API<=15.
* Fix: Fixes a bug in `ComponentUtils.isEquivalentTo()`.
* Fix: Correctly release `ComponentTree` on the main thread after `@OnDetached`.

For more details, see the [full diff](https://github.com/facebook/litho/compare/v0.34.0...v0.35.0).


## Version 0.34.0

_2020-02-09_

* **Breaking: Reconciliation for state updates is enabled by default**. Reconciliation makes state updates faster at the expense of increase in memory usage. New APIs added to explicitly disable reconciliation when an explicit `ComponentTree` is not set on the `LithoView`. Read more about it in [the documentation](http://fblitho.com/docs/reconciliation).
  - `LithoView.create(Context, Component, boolean)`
  - `LithoView.create(ComponentContext, Component, boolean)`
  - `LithoView.setComponentWithoutReconciliation(Component)`
  - `LithoView.setComponentAsyncWithoutReconciliation(Component)`
* **Breaking:** Merge `BaseLithoStartupLogging` abstract class, `LithoStartupLoggerUtil` helper class and `LithoStartupLogger` interface into single `LithoStartupLogger` abstract class.
* **Breaking:** Consolidate two layout calculation `PerfEvent`s into one: remove `FrameworkLogEvents.EVENT_LAYOUT_CALCULATE` and move some of its annotations to `FrameworkLogEvents.CALCULATE_LAYOUT_STATE` which will be used instead.
* **Breaking:** Make `varArg` props effectively optional with a `Collections.EMPTY_LIST` as a default value.

For more details, see the [full diff](https://github.com/facebook/litho/compare/v0.33.0...v0.34.0).


## Version 0.33.0

_2019-12-11_

* **Breaking: Changes in working with `ComparableDrawable`**. Litho's `DrawableWrapper` doesn't mimic Android Jetpack's implementations of `WrappedDrawable`, e.g. `WrappedDrawableApi21`, etc. Litho's wrapper will have to implement this correctly to have a legitimate chance of working across OS versions and all drawable types. This is not a good position to be in. It is better to remove the wrapper all together; this change doesn't remove it, but blocks usages except for specific internal ones. In essence, if a background or foreground `Drawable` is also a `ComparableDrawable`, Litho will invoke the `isEquivalentTo()` for comparison (instead of `equals()`). Also, `ComparableDrawable` is now an optional interface; so non comparable drawables will not be wrapped. The usage remains largely unchanged (except for the removal of Litho's `DrawableWrapper` implementation).
  - `ComparableDrawable` is a plain interface now (instead of a `Drawable`).
  - Remove `Component.Builder.background(ComparableDrawable)` and `Component.Builder.foreground(ComparableDrawable)`.
  - Remove `ComparableResDrawable`, `ComparableIntIdDrawable` and `DefaultComparableDrawable` implementations.
* **Breaking:** Provide global offset of the Section into `@OnDataRendered` method.
* **Breaking:** Fix default text size of `TextSpec`, `EditTextSpec` and `TextInputSpec` to be 14sp (from 13px).
* **Breaking:** FBJNI got removed from the build process. If you relied on `libfbjni.so` to be present, you can get the artifact from [the fbjni repository](https://github.com/facebookincubator/fbjni).
* **Breaking:** `LithoViewAssert.hasVisibleDrawable()` no longer relies on the broken `ShadowDrawable.equals()` implementation in Robolectric 3.X. Now Drawable equality relies on the descriptions being equal, or the resource ID they were created with being equal.
* **Breaking:** Remove unused `getKeyCollisionStackTraceBlacklist()` and `getKeyCollisionStackTraceKeywords()` from the `ComponentsReporter.Reporter` interface.
* New: Allow triggering `@OnTrigger` Events on Components using a `Handle` API.
* Fix: Propagate annotations specified on `@Param` args from `@OnEvent` methods to generated methods.
* Fix: Produce correct generated code for `@OnEvent` method when it has several args of the same generic type.
* Fix: Fix generating `@OnCalculateCachedValue` related methods when it has `ComponentContext` as a parameter.
* Fix: Fix `IndexOutOfBoundsException` in `RecyclerBinder.removeItemAt()` in Sections when `SingleComponentSection` is given a `null` Component.
* Fix: Support Dynamic Props for `LayoutSpec`s.

For more details, see the [full diff](https://github.com/facebook/litho/compare/v0.32.0...v0.33.0).

## Version 0.27.0

_2019-06-24_

 * **Breaking: Change in PerfEvents**:
   - Remove `FrameworkLogEvents.EVENT_CREATE_LAYOUT`, `FrameworkLogEvents.EVENT_CSS_LAYOUT `, and `FrameworkLogEvents.EVENT_COLLECT_RESULTS`: these are replaced by the sub-spans `"start_create_layout"`/`"end_create_layout"`, `"start_measure"`/`"end_measure"`, and `"start_collect_results"`/`"end_collect_results"` under the existing top-level `EVENT_CALCULATE_LAYOUT_STATE` event. The `PerfEvent.markerPoint()` API can be used to log these sub-spans. ([b859605](https://github.com/facebook/litho/commit/b859605258da6431b706d17c07df7bc8864396df))
   - Remove `FrameworkLogEvents.PREPARE_MOUNT` without replacement: this didn't provide much value. ([4917370](https://github.com/facebook/litho/commit/4917370d6a7405cddce01c13740f22e9ee736529))
   - Remove `FrameworkLogEvents.DRAW` without replacement: this was not free to maintain and didn't provide much value. ([9e548cb](https://github.com/facebook/litho/commit/9e548cbda5ad78d6f8d3a82ec42639439c118751))
 * **Breaking: The Default Range Ratio** for Sections/`RecyclerBinder` is changed from 4 screens worth of content in either direction to 2. This should improve resource usage with minimal effects on scroll performance. ([9b4fe95](https://github.com/facebook/litho/commit/9b4fe95b8cd48a15046b0d39c4f4756e50f35772))
 * **Breaking: `ComponentsSystrace.provide()`**: `ComponentsSystrace` now assumes an implementation will be provided before any other Litho operations occur. ([457a20f](https://github.com/facebook/litho/commit/457a20f660f14e7132e16668c21b4cf1ce766b70))
 * New: `ComponentsLogger` implementations can now return null for event types they don't care about. ([4075eb7](https://github.com/facebook/litho/commit/4075eb75c9a6f967111b451df6699d1b9b97671b))
 * New: Add `RecyclerCollectionEventsController.requestScrollBy()`. ([0146857](https://github.com/facebook/litho/commit/0146857653e29cb24491cbb8bee9307e55187365))
 * New: Add preliminary Robolectric v4 support. ([4c2f657](https://github.com/facebook/litho/commit/4c2f657f9e6edc45f78b9a8d82085025fa0fc86d), etc.)
 * New: More efficient code generation for state updates in Components and Sections. ([8c5c7e3](https://github.com/facebook/litho/commit/8c5c7e312fb7d1855caabc2fccbf5adc57e6e945), etc.)
 * Fix: Remove usage of API 19+ `Objects` class in cached value API. ([aabb24a](https://github.com/facebook/litho/commit/aabb24a5e67d30e5b93eb43f6c37aae91f455369))
 * Fix: Unset Components scope when creating a new `ComponentContext` in `ComponentTree`. ([05f11a7](https://github.com/facebook/litho/commit/05f11a74a4a06b4abcb1e302f56201609acccad2))
 * Fix: Fix perf logging for dirty mounts. ([3ad8bfb](https://github.com/facebook/litho/commit/3ad8bfba12a43e108602bcd8c63fd2404e6203cb))
 * Fix: Don't crash when `@OnCalculateCachedValue` takes no args. ([2a0f524](https://github.com/facebook/litho/commit/2a0f5240bc8c711d8e45db0e5426517f8bfbf49a))
 * Fix: Reduce number of systrace markers in `collectResults`: these were skewing the perceived size of `LayoutState.collectResults` in production and weren't actionable. ([3107467](https://github.com/facebook/litho/commit/3107467a4e3fd649821757699a5adba683f47edd))

## Version 0.26.1

_2019-05-28_

* Fix: Picks [513cf91](https://github.com/facebook/litho/commit/513cf91b747bdf06c6bda78840a9195e900d4deb) to fix an issue with the Flipper integration.

_2019-02-18_

 **Breaking: The default for state updates has changed from sync to async.** At Facebook this meant we ran a codemod script on the codebase and changed all state update methods to the explicit Sync variant (`"Sync"` is just appended to the end of the state update call), then changed the default. The reason for this is to not change existing behavior in case it breaks something, since there are many callsites. The script is committed and available at [scripts/codemod-state-update-methods.sh](scripts/codemod-state-update-methods.sh). We recommend using it if you have any concerns about state update calls automatically becoming async. As a reminder, when you add a `@OnUpdateState` method, it generates three methods: `updateState()`, `updateStateSync()`, and `updateStateAsync()`. Previously `updateState() == updateStateSync()`. Now, `updateState() == updateStateAsync()`.

## Version 0.23.0

_2019-01-16_

 * **Breaking:** `KeyHandler`s now get registered in EndToEnd tests ([9836497](https://github.com/facebook/litho/commit/9836497c15986ebafbfc2b87b1b4a9730fc73080)). This is a an edge-case, but potentially behavior-changing.
 * New: **Add support for [Cached Values](https://fblitho.com/docs/cached-values)**.
 * New: `isEquivalentTo` now uses reflection for size reasons unless the target is a `MountSpec` or `SectionSpec`. ([2e27d99](https://github.com/facebook/litho/commit/2e27d99b0ae75e8356b5654fa412cb66ec965411))
 * Fix: Potential NPE in `RecyclerEventsController`. ([8e29036](https://github.com/facebook/litho/commit/8e29036de52e5108d5e9853abfcb5571b5643e86))
