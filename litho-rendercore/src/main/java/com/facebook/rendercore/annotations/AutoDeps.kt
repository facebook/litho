package com.facebook.rendercore.annotations

/**
 * Marks a function or class whose dependency list the Litho compiler plugin infers.
 *
 * A participating declaration also names two parameters: [Deps] receives the inferred array, and
 * [DepsFrom] supplies the lambda whose captured values become the dependencies.
 *
 * ```
 * @AutoDeps
 * fun <T> ComponentScope.useCached(@Deps vararg inputs: Any?, @DepsFrom calculator: () -> T): T
 * ```
 *
 * At the call site, omitting the deps is the default and the intended shape:
 * ```
 * useCached { "$name has $count messages" }  // rewritten to useCached(name, count) { … }
 * useCached(Unit) { expensive() }            // untouched -- computed once
 * useCached(name) { "$name: $count" }        // untouched -- explicit deps always win
 * ```
 *
 * The three annotations must appear together; the plugin reports an error otherwise.
