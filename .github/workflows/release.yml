name: Publish on release commits

# This workflow detects commits with the message "Release version X.Y.Z" and kickstarts a build.
# Afterwards it runs tests in parallel before publishing and uploading it.
# When the upload is complete the revision is tagged them as a release
# and a script checks whether the artifacts are available.
#
# If the workflow fails any commit with the same version message
# will retag and trigger the workflow again.
