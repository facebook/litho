/**
 * Infers the dependency list of an `@AutoDeps` call site by reading the closure of its `@DepsFrom`
 * arguments.
 *
 * The base analysis cannot under-capture *what the lambda closes over*: it emits every value the
 * lambda reads from an enclosing scope, so the inferred set is a superset of the enclosing state
 * the body depends on. Only the two configured repairs -- `expand` and `ignore` -- can drop
 * something, which is why both are named in a reviewable config file rather than being implicit
 * compiler behaviour.
 *
 * State that is not closed over is out of scope by construction, and this is the same line React's
 * exhaustive-deps rule draws. A read of a top-level or `object` property has no closure to capture
 * it from, so it yields no dependency; if that state is mutable, the author must pass it
 * explicitly. Widening the analysis to reach it would mean reasoning about a declaration this one
 * does not recompile with -- the same reason interprocedural analysis is rejected.
 *
 * Comparing the dependencies is the framework's job, not the analysis's. A chain rooted at a
 * captured local depends on the local, so `user.name` depends on `user`, and a `user` mutated in
 * place rather than replaced compares equal to itself.
 *
 * A `var` the lambda reads or assigns is rejected. The dependency is read when the call is made and
 * the lambda reads the variable when it runs, so the two can disagree; and a lambda the framework
 * reuses writes to the variable of the call that created it, which no dependency value can tell
 * apart from the next call's.
 *
 * Four levels, per the design:
 * - **0**: every value read whose declaration lies outside the lambda.
 * - **1**: reads rooted at an enclosing receiver become property paths (`title`, not `this`).
 * - **2**: a captured local of an `expand` type becomes the free values of its initialiser.
 * - **3**: a captured local lambda becomes its own free values, so it stops invalidating every
 *   render.
 *
 * The analysis never reads a body in another file. That is a hard constraint, not a simplification:
 * interprocedural inference would make a call site's dependencies depend on a body it does not
 * recompile with.
