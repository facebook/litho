# 1. Overview

In this codelab, you'll learn about lifecycle methods used in GroupSections: we'll show you the execution order visually, and use the doc to introduce the purpose of each methods.

# 2. Setup the environment
Clone the following repo: [https://github.com/facebook/litho/tree/master/codelabs/group-section-lifecycle](https://github.com/facebook/litho/tree/master/codelabs/group-section-lifecycle)

# 3. Build the app and operate with it
Build the app with command `./gradlew app:installDebug` and launch it. From the bottom grid layout view, you can observe lifecycle methods are called.

# 4. Lifecycle method annotations
### @OnCreateInitialState
A method with this annotation is responsible to initialize State values. This method isn't mandatory if you don't have @â€‹State parmaters or don't need to initialize their values. Unlike other lifecycle methods, this method is called only once for the GroupSection.
```kotlin
@GroupSectionSpec
object LifecycleGroupSectionSpec {

  @OnCreateInitialState
  fun onCreateInitialState(
      c: SectionContext,
      startTime: StateValue<Long>,
  ) {
    val timestamp = SystemClock.uptimeMillis()
    startTime.set(timestamp)
  }
}
```

### @OnCreateTreeProp
A method with this annotation is responsible to generate [TreeProp](https://fblitho.com/docs/tree-props#declaring-a-treeprop). TreeProp is stored in the SectionTree and can be accessed by all child sections.
```kotlin
@GroupSectionSpec
object LifecycleGroupSectionSpec {

  @OnCreateTreeProp
  fun onCreateTreeProp(c: SectionContext, ...): YourTreeProp {
    return YourTreeProp(...)
  }
}
```

### @OnCreateChildren
A method with this annotation is responsible to return a [Children](https://fblitho.com/javadoc/com/facebook/litho/sections/Children.html) object, which is a container to contain the child sections. A child section can be a [GroupSectionSpec](https://fblitho.com/docs/group-sections) or a [DiffSectionSpec](https://fblitho.com/docs/diff-sections).
For @DiffSectionSpec, usually we send a `RenderEvent` event for each item, and the handler is responsible for rendering the component with given data. You can check [here](https://fblitho.com/docs/events-overview) for details about how to handle events.
```kotlin
@GroupSectionSpec
object LifecycleGroupSectionSpec {

  @OnCreateChildren
  fun onCreateChildren(
      c: SectionContext,
      @Prop items: List<Item>,
  ): Children {
    return Children.create()
        .child(
            DataDiffSection.create<Item>(c)
                .data(items)
                .renderEventHandler(LifecycleGroupSection.onRender(c))
        )
        .build()
  }

  @OnEvent(RenderEvent::class)
  fun onRender(c: SectionContext, @FromEvent model: Item): RenderInfo {
    return ComponentRenderInfo.create()
        .component(
            Text.create(c)
                .text(model.animal)
                .textSizeSp(20f)
                .paddingDip(YogaEdge.ALL, 8f))
        .build()
  }
}
```

### @OnDataBound
A method with this annotation will be called when the data changes corresponding to this section's hierarchy has been made available to the `SectionTree.Target.` Data changes could occur due to any number of the following:
  - Insert
  - Update
  - Delete
  - Move

```kotlin
@GroupSectionSpec
object LifecycleGroupSectionSpec {

  @OnDataBound
  fun onDataBound(c: SectionContext, ...) {
    ...
  }
}
```

### @OnDataRendered
A method with this annotation will be called when the dataset corresponding to this section is now rendered completely on viewport.

Parameters in the method:
- *isDataChanged* - True if the dataset is changed, false otherwise.
- *isMounted* - True if the section is shown on the viewport, false otherwise.
- *uptimeMillis* - The timestamp when the method is called.
- *firstVisibleIndex* - First visible item index in the section.
- *lastVisibleIndex* - Last visible item index in the section.
- *changesInfo*  - A collection of Changes between previous/current sections, each change represents a operation(insert, update, delete, or move).
```
@GroupSectionSpec
object LifecycleGroupSectionSpec {

  @OnDataRendered
  fun onDataRendered(
      c: SectionContext,
      isDataChanged: Boolean,
      isMounted: Boolean,
      uptimeMillis: Long,
      firstVisibleIndex: Int,
      lastVisibleIndex: Int,
      changesInfo: ChangesInfo
  ) {
    ...
  }
}
```

### @OnViewportChanged
A method annotated with this annotation will be called when first/last visible index of the section in the viewport changes.
```kotlin
@GroupSectionSpec
object LifecycleGroupSectionSpec {

  @OnViewportChanged
  fun onViewportChanged(
      c: SectionContext,
      firstVisibleIndex: Int,
      lastVisibleIndex: Int,
      totalCount: Int,
      firstFullyVisibleIndex: Int,
      lastFullyVisibleIndex: Int
  ) {
    ...
  }
}
```

### @OnRefresh
A method annotated with this annotation will be called when the section requests a refresh of its content.
```
@GroupSectionSpec
object LifecycleGroupSectionSpec {

  @OnRefresh
  fun onDataRendered(c: SectionContext, ...) {
    ...
  }
}
```

### @OnCreateService
A method annotated with this annotation will be called when the section is created for the first time and is responsible to create a Service object it wishes to use. Service object is persistent across state updates as long as the section remains in the hierarchy.

```kotlin
@GroupSectionSpec
object LifecycleGroupSectionSpec {

  @OnCreateService
  fun onCreateService(c: SectionContext, ...): YourService {
    return YourService()
  }
}
```

### @OnBindService
A method with this annotation will be called whenever the Service has been created or transferred from the old tree to the new tree and are therefore ready to be used.
```kotlin
@GroupSectionSpec
object LifecycleGroupSectionSpec {

  @OnBindService
  fun onBindService(c: SectionContext, service: YourService, ...) {
  }
}
```

### @OnUnbindService
A method annotated with this annotation will be called when the Service has been transferred from the old tree to the new tree. It allows you to clean up and undo anything you have done in @OnBindService method.
```kotlin
@GroupSectionSpec
object LifecycleGroupSectionSpec {

  @OnUnbindService
  fun onUnbindService(c: SectionContext, service: YourService, ...) {
    // Clean up or reset the service.
  }
}
```
