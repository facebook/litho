/**
 * Unit tests for LithoCollectionItem view recycling behavior, specifically testing the fix for
 * RecyclerView change animation bugs where the same item is bound to multiple views.

 * These tests verify that:
 * 1. Normal recycling works correctly (view is cleaned when it's the current view)
 * 2. Change animation scenario works correctly (old view is cleaned proactively, not on recycle)
 * 3. View tracking is properly maintained across bindings
