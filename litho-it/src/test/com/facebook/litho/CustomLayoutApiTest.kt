   * two passes can disagree — the container under test exists once the tree is built but has no
   * size until that layout ends. A nested pass that committed it would place it against a box of
   * zero, and the commit happens once per pass, so the enclosing pass would not get to correct it.
   *
   * The deferred sibling is declared first so the nested pass runs before Yoga reaches the
   * container, and is measured at a size the viewport will not satisfy so that the cached result is
   * unusable — that is what sends `LayoutUtils.measureDeferredNode` down the branch re-measuring
   * against the enclosing `LithoLayoutContext` rather than a fresh one.
   *
   * Every part of that shape is load-bearing, and the whole test is vacuous without it. Giving the
   * deferred sibling a plain `Column` instead of a container of its own is enough: the re-measure
   * is then answered from cache, no pass ever nests, and the test passes whatever the placement
   * code does. If this needs changing, check it still fails when `LithoLayoutContext.layoutPass`
