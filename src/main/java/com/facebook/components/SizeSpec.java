/**
 * A SizeSpec encapsulates the layout requirements passed from parent to child.
 * Each SizeSpec represents a requirement for either the width or the height.
 * A SizeSpec is comprised of a size and a mode. There are two possible
 * modes:
 * <dl>
 * <dt>UNSPECIFIED</dt>
 * <dd>
 * The parent has not imposed any constraint on the child. It can be whatever size
 * it wants.
 * </dd>
 *
 * <dt>EXACTLY</dt>
 * <dd>
 * The parent has determined an exact size for the child. The child is going to be
 * given those bounds regardless of how big it wants to be.
 * </dd>
 *
 * SizeSpecs are implemented as ints to reduce object allocation. This class
 * is provided to pack and unpack the &lt;size, mode&gt; tuple into the int.
