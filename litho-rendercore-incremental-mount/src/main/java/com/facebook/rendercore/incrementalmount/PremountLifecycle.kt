 *                                                        ▲                     │

 * ```
 *
 * Untracked items are not in the map and behave exactly as Incremental Mount does today.
 *
 * Every write takes the [PremountSession] that started the work. A new layout or a teardown starts
 * a new session (or none), so work that finishes late is answered with `STALE` / `false` and
 * changes nothing.
 *
 * Acquire and release are split into `begin` (decide) and `finish` (record), because the physical
 * mount or unmount in between can re-enter Incremental Mount.
 *
 * Main thread only.
