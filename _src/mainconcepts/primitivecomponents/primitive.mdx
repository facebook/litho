title: Lifecycle of a Primitive Component
---

A `Primitive` represents a reusable unit responsible for hosting the logic to create, measure, and mount the content that the Primitive Component will render.

As illustrated in the [Creating a Primitive Component](primitive-component.mdx#creating-a-primitive-component) page, the `render()` method should return a `Primitive` implementation and any `Style` object to be applied to the component on the `LithoPrimitive` object.

This page provides an overview of a `Primitive`: a composable API that can be configured to provide a bespoke implementation.

A Primitive consists of:
 - LayoutBehavior - defines how a Primitive measures itself
 - MountConfiguration - defines how a Primitive mounts and configures a View or a Drawable associated with that Primitive

## Lifecycle of a Primitive

A Primitive has four important stages in its lifecycle, which occur in the following order:

1. [Creation](#creation-of-a-primitive)
1. [Content size measurement](#content-size-measurement)
1. [Content creation](#content-creation)
1. [Mounting and unmounting content properties](#mounting-and-unmounting-content-properties)

Each of these stages is detailed in the following sub-sections.

### Creation of a Primitive

In order to create a Primitive, create an instance of a [Primitive](https://github.com/facebook/litho/blob/75655943f348c0347d534e6931fb53b2f7f16195/litho-rendercore-primitives/src/main/java/com/facebook/rendercore/primitives/Primitive.kt#L36) class.

The following example provides an implementation of `Primitive` with an `ImageView` as content:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/primitives/SimpleImageViewPrimitiveComponent.kt start=start_image_primitive_component_example end=end_image_primitive_component_example
```

### Content size measurement

:::note
This stage of the Primitive's lifecycle can occur on any thread.
:::

Each Primitive should privide an implementation of [LayoutBehavior](https://github.com/facebook/litho/blob/75655943f348c0347d534e6931fb53b2f7f16195/litho-rendercore-primitives/src/main/java/com/facebook/rendercore/primitives/LayoutBehavior.kt#L30) interface to define how it measures itself given arbitrary width and height specs. The `PrimitiveLayoutResult` object it returns contains the width and height of the content, and optionally any layout data, as shown in the following example:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/primitives/SimpleImageViewPrimitiveComponent.kt start=start_image_primitive_layout_behavior_example end=end_image_primitive_layout_behavior_example
```

To learn about the different strategies to measure content, see the [Measuring](primitive-measuring.mdx) page.

### Content creation

:::note
This stage of the Primitive's lifecycle can only occur on the main thread.
:::

Each Primitive needs to create the content it hosts (either a `View` or a `Drawable`) by providing [a ViewAllocator or a DrawableAllocator](https://github.com/facebook/litho/blob/75655943f348c0347d534e6931fb53b2f7f16195/litho-rendercore-primitives/src/main/java/com/facebook/rendercore/primitives/ContentAllocator.kt#L34-L64) to the `MountBehavior`, as shown in the following example:

```kotlin file=litho-widget/src/main/java/com/facebook/litho/widget/ExperimentalImage.kt start=start_image_primitive_mount_behavior_example end=end_image_primitive_mount_behavior_example
```

:::note
The content should not be mutated based on props passed to the PrimitiveComponent.
:::

In order to optimize the mount performance, the properties of the View/Drawable Allocator can also be customized to adjust the [content pooling](primitive-preallocation.mdx) strategy.

### Mounting and unmounting content properties

:::note
This stage of the Primitive's lifecycle can only occur on the main thread.
:::

Properties can be set and unset on the content using `bindTo`, `bind`, and `bindWithLayoutData` methods inside of `MountBehavior` scope.

The following code shows a component that appropriately sets and unsets the properties on the content:

```kotlin file=litho-widget/src/main/java/com/facebook/litho/widget/ExperimentalImage.kt start=start_image_primitive_mount_behavior_example end=end_image_primitive_mount_behavior_example
```

Methods like `bind` and `bindWithLayoutData` take dependencies as an argument. Any time dependencies changes between layouts, the `onUnbind {}` callback will be invoked, followed by `bind` or `bindWithLayoutData`. Dependencies should include **all** the props/state that are used to configure the content inside bind/bindWithLayoutData/onUnbind calls.

:::note
Dependencies are checked for equivalence by calling equals.
:::

:::note Important
Once set, a property should be unset in the `onUnbind {}` callback to ensure correctness when the content is reused.
