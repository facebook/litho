The **Litho Testing API** is presented through the `LithoViewRule` class, it enables the following:

- Make assertions against the Component hierarchy.
- Mark assertions against the View hierarchy.
- Provides access to utility functions to interact with the View hierarchy (such as by clicking).

`LithoViewRule` uses the Junit 'TestRule', which provides a flexible mechanism to execute code before and after a test method. As a result, Litho is able to prepare the environment then clean it up after testing has taken place, so there's no need to be concerned about it.

For more information about the TestRules, refer to the official [JUnit documentation](https://junit.org/junit4/javadoc/4.12/org/junit/rules/TestRule.html).

## Adding Dependencies

In order to use the Litho Testing API, the `litho-testing` dependency needs to be added into the relevant BUCK file:

```python title="BUCK"
deps = [
    "//fbandroid/libraries/components/litho-testing/src/main/java/com/facebook/litho/testing:testing"
],
```

## Basics

In order to use the @Rule inside of a test class, it needs to be initialised:

```kotlin file=litho-core/src/test/kotlin/com/facebook/litho/examples/LithoTestRuleExampleTest.kt start=start_example end=end_example
```

Then, within a test, render the component with the help of the `LithoViewRule.render(Component)` method and perform assertions or other actions on the `LithoView` returned by the `render` call:

```kotlin file=litho-core/src/test/kotlin/com/facebook/litho/examples/LithoTestRuleExampleTest.kt start=start_render_example end=end_render_example
```

## What next?

The remaining pages in this section describe how to use [assertions](testing-assertions.mdx) and how to [interact](testing-actions.mdx) with components.
