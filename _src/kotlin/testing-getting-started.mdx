The **Litho Testing API** is presented through the `LithoViewRule` class, it enables the following:

- Make assertions against the Component hierarchy.
- Mark assertions against the View hierarchy.
- Provides access to utility functions to interact with the View hierarchy (such as by clicking).

`LithoViewRule` uses the Junit 'TestRule', which provides a flexible mechanism to execute code before and after a test method. As a result, Litho is able to prepare the environment then clean it up after testing has taken place, so you don't have to worry about it.

If you would like to read more about the TestRules, refer to the official [JUnit documentation](https://junit.org/junit4/javadoc/4.12/org/junit/rules/TestRule.html).

## Adding Dependencies

In order to use the Litho Testing API, you'll need to add the `litho-testing` dependency into your BUCK file:

```python title="BUCK"
deps = [
    "//fbandroid/libraries/components/litho-testing/src/main/java/com/facebook/litho/testing:testing"
],
```

## Basics

In order to use the @Rule inside of your test class you need to initialise it:

```kotlin file=litho-core-kotlin/src/test/kotlin/com/facebook/litho/examples/LithoViewRuleExampleTest.kt start=start_example end=end_example
```

Then, within a test, you render your component with the help of the `LithoViewRule.render(Component)` method and perform assertions or other actions on the `LithoView` returned by the `render` call:

```kotlin file=litho-core-kotlin/src/test/kotlin/com/facebook/litho/examples/LithoViewRuleExampleTest.kt start=start_render_example end=end_render_example
```

## What next?

The remaining pages in this section describe how to use [Assertions](testing-assertions.mdx) and how to [interact with your Components](testing-actions.mdx).
