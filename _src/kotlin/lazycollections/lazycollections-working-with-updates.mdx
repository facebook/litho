title: Working with Updates
---

A lazy collection is updated by changing the changing the prop/state values from which it is generated. To ensure correctness and performance you must:

1. [Provide ids](#child-identity) for any children that can be updated.
2. Make sure props of children don't unnecessarily change, leading to [unnecessary layouts](#avoiding-unecessary-layouts).

## Child Identity

When the data backing a lazy collection is updated, children may have been added, removed, changed position, or had their content updated. The lazy collection will determine what has changed and apply the minimal changeset. This is done by comparing items from the old and new lists using the `id` parameter specified on the children.

By default, an 'id' is generated for each child based on its position and type. This is only sufficient for simple static lists. If the list is expected to be updated, you should provide an id that is consistent across renders.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/collection/ApplyingUpdates.kt start=start_id_example end=end_id_example
```

**An `id` must be unique and immutable.** Breaking this contract may lead to occasional `IndexOutOfBoundsException` exceptions during layout.

**You should always provide an `id` when adding items in a loop.** Using the loop index is unacceptable as items may change positions. Instead, use an id from the data model.

## Avoiding Unnecessary Layouts

During a list update, if a child with the same `id` is found in the old and new lists then the lazy collection automatically detects if the content has changed. If an update has not occurred, the subtree will be re-used as-is, otherwise it is re-created.

Content changes are detected by checking the equality of the component's props. **If any component prop does not implement an `equals()` then it cannot be reused**. It is common for classes to not implement `equals()` such as Drawables, Lambdas, and data models. A little bit more work is required to avoid unnecessary layouts when these are used.

**The behaviour will be functionally correct by default.** If you use props that do not provide an `equals()` the UI will still use the most up-to-date prop and state values. However, there will be unnecessary layouts which will impact performance.

### Using Classes Without `equals()` as Props

If a component accepts a prop that does not implement an `equals()` then it will never be reused.

Consider the following example:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/collection/ApplyingUpdates.kt start=start_name_list_unnecessary_update end=end_name_list_unnecessary_update
```

In the above example, `NameComponent` will be laid out on any update because it takes a prop of type `Name` that does not implement an `equals()`.

Unnecessary layouts can be avoided using two methods:

1. Add an `equals()` to the `Name` class, such as by making it a `data` class. This approach will not be possible if you're using an object provided by a framework you don't control.
2. Manually specify the dependencies that, if changed, should trigger an update.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/collection/ApplyingUpdates.kt start=start_name_list_fixed end=end_name_list_fixed
```

By manually specifying the dependencies, `NameComponent` is only be laid out once and re-used whenever the Example is updated.

Consider the following example, which uses an Android `Drawable`:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/collection/ApplyingUpdates.kt start=start_drawable_unnecessary_update end=end_drawable_unnecessary_update
```

In the above example, the Text component will be unnecessarily laid out on every update to Example because ColorDrawable does not implement an `equals()`.

Here, Unnecessary layouts can be avoided using two techniques:

1. Use a drawable that implements equality such as Litho’s ComparableColorDrawable.
2. Manually specify the dependencies that, if changed, will trigger an update.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/collection/ApplyingUpdates.kt start=start_drawable_fixed end=end_drawable_fixed
```

### Using Lambdas as Props

Lambdas do not provide an `equals()`, for example, `{} == {}` is `false`. This means that using a lambda as a prop may cause unnecessary layouts.

Furthermore, lambdas capture values when they are created. For example, in the folling lambda, `{ val time = Calendar.getInstance().time }`, the value `time` will contain the time the lambda was created not the time when it was invoked. This means it is not possible to prevent updates using `deps` as the lambda needs to be regenerated to capture the latest state and prop values.

To use a lambda in a Lazy Collection, wrap it in a `useCallback` hook.  This provides equality across layouts, allowing the component to be reused, and the lambda is guaranteed to use the latest prop and state values

Consider the following example where a lambda is passed to a component:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/collection/ApplyingUpdates.kt start=start_lambda_unnecessary_update end=end_lambda_unnecessary_update
```

In the above example, the Text will be laid out on any update to Example because the lambda props will never be equal. This can be fixed using the `useCallback` hook:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/collection/ApplyingUpdates.kt start=start_lambda_fixed end=end_lambda_fixed
```

Consider another example, this time displaying a shopping list:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/collection/ApplyingUpdates.kt start=start_shopping_list_example end=end_shopping_list_example
```

Each shopping list item requires a lambda to toggle a checkmark. If an unwrapped lambda was used, then no component would ever be reused as lambda does not provide an `equals()`. Instead, wrap the lambda in a `useCallback` hook. This provides equality across renders and ensure that changes are applied to the latest version of the `checkedItems` state.
