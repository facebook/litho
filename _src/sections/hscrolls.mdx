Vertical scrolling lists usually fill the width of the screen so it's easy to measure them with a fixed size. Working with horizontal scrolling lists (h-scroll) is not always so trivial because different height settings have different performance implications.

To see how to create a h-scroll, using a `RecyclerCollectionComponent`, refer to the 'Horizontal Lists' section of the [Adding and Adapting the RecyclerCollection to your App](recycler-collection-component.md#horizontal-lists) page.

## Setting the height of a horizontal RecyclerCollectionComponent

You can set the height of a horizontally scrolling `RecyclerCollectionComponent` with the following methods:

* [Fixed height method](#fixed-height-method) - a fixed height is set on the H-Scroll component.  This is the most performant method and is recommended where possible.
* [Unknown height method](#unknown-height-method) - height is not known when the Component is created so let the h-scroll set its height to the height of the first item.
* [Dynamic height method](#dynamic-height-method) - lets the h-scroll dynamically change its height to fit the tallest item.  This is the least performant method.

Each of these methods is detailed in the following sub-sections.

### Fixed height method

Using this method, a fixed height is set on the h-Scroll Component.  The client knows the height of the h-scroll when it creates it, but it cannot be changed once the h-scroll gets measured.

Children of this h-scroll are measured with, at most, the height of the h-scroll.  Taller children will be clipped, and smaller children will be positioned at the start of the h-scroll.

:::note
In Litho, this is the most performant (efficient) way to set the height of a h-scroll. It's recommended to use this option whenever possible.
:::

To use this preferred method, set the height through the `height` prop on your `RecyclerCollectionComponent`:

```kotlin
@LayoutSpec
object FixedHeightHscrollComponentSpec {

    @OnCreateLayout
    fun onCreateLayout(c: ComponentContext, @Prop colors: List<Int>): Component {
        return RecyclerCollectionComponent.create(c)
          .recyclerConfiguration(ListRecyclerConfiguration.create().orientation(OrientationHelper.HORIZONTAL).build())
          .section(DataDiffSection.create<Int>(SectionContext(c))
            .data(colors)
            .renderEventHandler(FixedHeightHscrollComponent.onRender(c))
            .build())
          .heightDip(150f)
          .build()
    }

    @OnEvent(RenderEvent::class)
    fun onRender(c: ComponentContext, @FromEvent model: Int): RenderInfo {
        return ComponentRenderInfo.create()
          .component(SolidColor.create(c).color(model).heightDip(100f).widthDip(100f))
          .build()
    }
}
```

The code produces the structure shown in the following image.

![fixedheight](/images/fixed-height-hscroll.png)

Notice the grey background is the actual bounds of the h-scroll, and the children have smaller heights.

### Unknown height method

Using this method, the height is unknown when the Component is created. The height is determined by measuring the first child of the h-scroll and setting that as the height of the h-scroll.

This measurement occurs only when the h-scroll is first measured, after which the height cannot be changed. All other children heights will be measured with, at most, the height of the h-scroll and position at the start of the h-scroll.

To enable this, instead of passing a `height` prop on the `RecyclerCollectionComponent`, specify `crossAxisWrapMode` as `CrossAxisWrapMode.MatchFirstChild` it should measure itself:

```kotlin
@LayoutSpec
object MeasureFirstItemForHeightHscrollComponentSpec {

    @OnCreateLayout
    fun onCreateLayout(c: ComponentContext, @Prop colors: List<Int>): Component {
      return RecyclerCollectionComponent.create(c)
          .recyclerConfiguration(
              ListRecyclerConfiguration.create()
                  .orientation(OrientationHelper.HORIZONTAL)
                  .recyclerBinderConfiguration(
                      RecyclerBinderConfiguration.create()
                          .recyclerBinderConfig(
                              RecyclerBinderConfig(
                                  crossAxisWrapMode = CrossAxisWrapMode.MatchFirstChild))
                          .build())
                  .build())
          .section(
              DataDiffSection.create<Int>(SectionContext(c))
                  .data(colors)
                  .renderEventHandler(MeasureFirstItemForHeightHscrollComponent.onRender(c))
                  .build())
          .build()
    }

    @OnEvent(RenderEvent::class)
    fun onRender(c: ComponentContext, @FromEvent model: Int, @FromEvent index: Int): RenderInfo {
      if (index == 0) {
        return ComponentRenderInfo.create()
          .component(SolidColor.create(c).color(model).heightDip(100f).widthDip(100f))
          .build()
      }

      if (index == 1) {
         return ComponentRenderInfo.create()
           component(SolidColor.create(c).color(model).heightDip(200f).widthDip(100f))
           .build()
      }

      return ComponentRenderInfo.create()
        .component(SolidColor.create(c).color(model).heightDip(50f).widthDip(100f))
        .build()
    }
}
```

The code produces the structure shown in the following image.

![canmeasure](/images/canmeasure.png)

In this case, the first child has a height of 100dip; the second child has a height of 200dip, but it's cropped to fit the size of the h-scroll as determined by the first child. Once measured like this, the height cannot be changed. The grey background represents the bounds of the h-scroll.

:::note
If you don't set a non-zero height on the `RecyclerCollectionComponent` and never change `crossAxisWrapMode`(Its default value is `CrossAxisWrapMode.NoWrap`), your RecyclerCollectionComponent will end up with a height of zero.
:::

### Dynamic height method

:::caution
This is the least performant (inefficient) method. Enabling this option should be done only if absolutely needed and should especially be avoided for lists with infinite scrolling.
:::

Using this method, the h-scroll dynamically changes its height to fit the tallest item.

H-Scrolls can be configured to support items of different height or remeasuring of the height if the height of the children could change after the initial measurement.

In this case:

* The initial height of the h-scroll is determined by the height of the tallest child.
* If a child wants to expand to become taller than the current height of the h-scroll, the h-scroll will be remeasured with the new height of the child. Other items will not be remeasured.
* If the child with the biggest height collapses, then the h-scroll will again determine what its height should be by remeasuring all the items.

Measuring all the children to determine the tallest comes with a high-performance cost, especially for infinite loading h-scrolls when the height needs to be remeasured every time new items are inserted.

If you must use this method, you can pass your own [RecyclerConfiguration](pathname:///javadoc/com/facebook/litho/sections/widget/RecyclerConfiguration.html) to the `RecyclerCollectionComponent` and enable `CrossAxisWrapMode.Dynamic` on the [RecyclerBinderConfiguration](pathname:///javadoc/com/facebook/litho/sections/widget/RecyclerBinderConfiguration.html) that is used to create the `RecyclerConfiguration`, as shown in the following code:

```kotlin
RecyclerCollectionComponent.create(c)
    .recyclerConfiguration(
        ListRecyclerConfiguration.create()
            .orientation(OrientationHelper.HORIZONTAL)
            .recyclerBinderConfiguration(
                RecyclerBinderConfiguration.create()
                    .recyclerBinderConfig(
                        RecyclerBinderConfig(crossAxisWrapMode = CrossAxisWrapMode.Dynamic))
                    .build())
            .build())
    .section(
        DataDiffSection.create<Int>(SectionContext(c))
            .data(colors)
            .renderEventHandler(DynamicHeightHscrollComponent.onRender(c))
            .build())
    .build()
```

In the short video below, you can see that the h-scroll will remeasure to always adjust height to accommodate the tallest item, but it won't collapse to fit a smaller maximum height.
