title: Creating a Mountable Component

Mountable Components can be used to render views or drawables on the screen.

## Comparison with KComponents

There are several similarities between Mountable Components and [KComponents](/mainconcepts/components-basics.mdx):

* They both consist of a render function that can use the component's [props](../mainconcepts/props.mdx) and [hooks](../mainconcepts/hooks-intro.mdx).
* As with KComponents, mountable components are subject to [rules](../mainconcepts/components-basics.mdx/#rules-for-components) for their use.
* Just like KComponents, mountable components can be configured using common props and state.

## Creating a Mountable Component

The following example shows a Mountable Component that will return a 'mountable' that creates an 'ImageView' to be rendered on the screen.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/mountables/SimpleImageViewComponent.kt start=start_simple_mountable_component_example end=end_simple_mountable_component_example
```

A Mountable represents a reusable unit responsible for hosting the logic to create, measure, and bind the content that the Mountable Component will render. For more information, see the [Mountable](mountable.mdx) page.

As can be seen from the above example, the `render()` function returns:

* A `MountableRenderResult` object that contains a 'Mountable' to be rendered
* A `style` object that is applied to the mountable component.

:::note
The `render()` method can be invoked from multiple threads. You should **not** assume it can only be called from the main thread. The implementation of render should not cause side effects; essentially, it acts like a pure function.
