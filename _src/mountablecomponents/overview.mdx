Mountable Components are used to render views or drawables and are a replacement for the old Java Specs API-based [Mount Specs](../codegen/mount-specs.md).

Mountable Components should only be created when you need to integrate your own views/drawables with Litho. Here, *Mount* refers to the operation performed by all components in a layout tree to extract their rendered state (a 'View' or a 'Drawable') to be displayed.

The Mountable Components section contains the following pages:

* [Creating a Mountable Component](mountable-component.mdx) - details how to create a Component responsible for rendering a View or Drawable. Also, compares Mountable Components with KComponents.
* [Lifecycle of a Mountable](mountable.mdx) - covers the purpose and creation of a Mountable in addition to how to create and bind its content.
* [Measuring](mountable-measuring.mdx) - shows different strategies to measure the content the Mountable Component will render.
* [BindTo - Dynamic Values API](mountable-bindto.mdx) - illustrates the use of the BindTo API by implementing a simple `ImageViewComponent` with specific properties, which are animated based on the values of a `SeekBar`.
* [Controllers Pattern](mountable-controllers.mdx) - illustrates the use of controllers by implementing a simple TimePicker that shows an arbitrary time.
* [Content Pooling](mountable-preallocation.mdx) - details a strategy that can be used to populate the content pools to optimise first mount performance.
* [Accessibility](accessibility.mdx) - explains why accessibility is importanta and how to implement accessibility features, and lists the supported accessibility events of the `Style` object.
* [Introduction to RenderCore](introduction-to-rendercore.mdx) - introduces the engine responsible for rendering Mountable Components.

The Migrating to Mountable Components section contains step-by-step explanations of how to migrate to Mountable Components from already existing components:
* [Migrating from MountSpecs](migrating-from-mountspecs.mdx) - details the process of migrating from MountSpec API.
* [Cheatsheet](mountable-cheatsheet.mdx) - set of links for the migration of individual aspects of existing code from the Java Spec API to Kotlin API.
