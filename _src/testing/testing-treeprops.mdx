title: Matching @TreeProp

:::tip Tips
For help with setting up the test environment, see the [Getting Started](unit-testing.mdx) page.

Before learning about `@TreeProp` matching, it's recommended you become familiar with [sub-component testing](subcomponent-testing.mdx).

## Testing components with @TreeProp

While `@Prop`s are received from the immediate parent, [`@TreeProp`](/codegen/passing-data-to-components/treeprops.mdx)s can be passed down to a component from any of its ancestors in the current component hierarchy. When testing hierarchies containing components that contain `@TreeProp`, the TreeProp should be passed down to the components as expected. Following is an example LayoutSpec:

```java
@LayoutSpec
class ComponentWithTreePropSpec {
  @OnCreateLayout
  static Component onCreateLayout(
      ComponentContext c,
      @Prop String normalProp,
      @TreeProp UserContext userContext) { // <- Passed down by an ancestor.
    // ...
  }
}
```

To test a component that uses `@TreeProp`s, you can use `LithoTestRule#setTreeProp(Class, Object)`. This will set `@TreeProp`s on the hierachy, making them available to the components:

```java
@RunWith(LithoTestRunner.class)
public class ComponentWithTreePropTest {

  public final @Rule LithoTestRule mLithoTestRule = new LithoTestRule();

  @Test
  public void test() {
    final ComponentContext c = mLithoTestRule.getContext();
    final Component component = ComponentWithTreeProp.create(c).build();

    mLithoTestRule
      .attachToWindow()
      .setTreeProp(UserContext.class, new UserContext()) // setting tree props for the hierarchy.
      .setRoot(component)
      .measure()
      .layout();

    // test assertions as usual
  }
}
```

:::info
`@TestSpec` does not support matching `@TreeProp`.
