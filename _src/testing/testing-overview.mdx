This page contains a brief overview of the variety of tools, provided by Litho, to write different types of tests.

## Unit Testing

Litho provides a suite of helpers to make unit testing easier. To learn about the setup with the Litho JUnit Rules and AssertJ helpers, refer to the [Getting Started](unit-testing.mdx) page of the 'Unit Tests' section of the Litho documentation.

* [Sub-Component Testing](subcomponent-testing.mdx) - a common way to test components is by testing assertions on the component hierarchy; this means finding components that are expected to be present or absent in the component tree. The sub-component APIs provide utility methods to easily write such tests.

* **Prop Matching** - provides APIs to write tests for asserting the prop values set on the components in the hierarchy:

  * [**Matching @Prop**](prop-matching.mdx)
  * [**Matching @TreeProp**](testing-treeprops.mdx)
  * [**EventHandler Testing**](event-handler-testing.mdx)

* [Testing Section](sections-testing.md) - Section hierarchies can be tested using the SectionComponentTestHelper and SubSection APIs.

## End-to-End Testing (E2E Tests)

Litho also provides utilities for writing E2E tests powered by Espresso. For more information, see the [End-to-End Tests](espresso-testing.mdx) page in the 'UI Tests' section of the Litho documentation.

## Android Studio

To run unit tests in Android Studio, refer to the [Testing in Android Studio](tests-in-android-studio.mdx) page.
