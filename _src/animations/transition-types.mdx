Litho APIs enable you to create animated transitions between two consecutive `LayoutStates` of the UI. Within this page, those states are referred to as *before* and *after*.

When defining transitions, you need to indicate to the framework what `Component`/`AnimatedProperty` pairs you want it to animate. Based on presence of the `Component` in *before* and *after* states, you can define three types of transitions: [changing](#change-transitions), [appearing](#appear-transitions), and [disappearing](#disappear-transitions).

### Change Transitions

A transition where the target `Component` is present in both *before* and *after* layouts is called a *change* transition.

The sample in the [Animation Basics](/docs/animations/transition-basics) page features a *change* transition, since the `'square'` `Component` is always present in the layout, but it changes its position (`X` property).

From a user's perspective, change transitions are the simplest type. Following is the explanation of how change type transitions work internally.

Imagine layout *A* (*before*) is mounted (rendered on the screen) and there is a blueprint of the layout *B* (*after*), which the framework is ready to render. The transition is defined for a  `AnimatedProperty.P` of a `ComponentC`, where `ComponentC` is present in both layouts.

The framework needs to take the following steps in order to run *change* animations:

1. Pick the current value of the `AnimatedProperty.P` from the mounted UI element (normally, a `View`) that represents `ComponentC` on the screen; this is going to be the *start* value for animation.
2. Pick the animation *end* value of `AnimatedProperty.P` from the blueprint of layout *B*.
3. When the layout *B* is mounted to the screen, new value of `P` is not applied right away, as normally occurs. Instead, keep the previous value in place, but subscribe to the [`Choreographer`](pathname:///javadoc/com/facebook/litho/choreographercompat/ChoreographerCompat.html), and start changing the value of `P` for the new mounted UI element on every frame until it reaches the end value.

Following is how the returned trees look like on both layout passes (`ComponentC` is present in both trees):

**Before**

```java
Column.create(c)
    .child(
        SolidColor.create(c) // -> ComponentC
            .color(YELLOW)
            .widthDip(80)
            .heightDip(80)
            .transitionKey(SQUARE_KEY))
    .alignItems(YogaAlign.FLEX_START) // AnimatedProperty.X aligned to start
    .build();
```

**After**

```java
Column.create(c)
    .child(
        SolidColor.create(c) // -> ComponentC
            .color(YELLOW)
            .widthDip(80)
            .heightDip(80)
            .transitionKey(SQUARE_KEY))
    .alignItems(YogaAlign.FLEX_END) // AnimatedProperty.X aligned to end
    .build();
```

### Appear Transitions

In certain situations, you may want to animate how a certain UI element appears on screen.

In this case of *Appearing* transitions, a `Component` is present in the *after* `LayoutState`, but wasn't seen in the *before* `LayoutState`. In order to run transitions, *start* and *end* values of the `AnimatedProperty` are needed. While the framework can only get the latter from the layout, it is the responsibility of the user to supply the *start* value. You can do this using `.appearFrom()` method when building a `Transition`, as shown in the folloiwng snippet:

```java file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/java/animations/docs/AppearTransitionComponentSpec.java start=start end=end
```

<video loop="true" autoplay="true" class="video" width="100%" height="500px">
  <source type="video/webm" src={useBaseUrl("/videos/transitions/appear.webm")}></source>
  <p>Your browser does not support the video element.</p>
</video>

Following are the details of how the framework handles these transitions internally:

1. Pick the `appearFrom` value of the `AnimatedProperty.P` from `Transition` object - this is going to be the *start* value for the animation.
2. As before, pick the animation *end* value of `AnimatedProperty.P` from the blueprint of layout *B*.
3. When the layout *B* is mounted to the screen, instead of applying the *end* value from that layout to the mounted item immediately, we set the user-provided *appearFrom* value and drive that to the *end* value from the layout.

`ComponentC` is only present in the *after* tree.

**Before**

```java
child = null;

Column.create(c)
    .child(child) // ComponentC is null here
    .alignItems(YogaAlign.FLEX_END)
    .build();
```

**After**:

```java
child = SolidColor.create(c)
    .color(YELLOW)
    .widthDip(80)
    .heightDip(80)
    .transitionKey(SQUARE_KEY);

Column.create(c)
    .child(child) // ComponentC is present and will be animated.
    .alignItems(YogaAlign.FLEX_END)
    .build();
```

### Disappear Transitions

The opposite of *Appearing* type of transitions is *Disappearing*: when the `Component` is present in *before* layout, but is gone in the *after* layout. Following the same logic as before, now the responsibility of providing the *end* value falls on the user, which is done by using `.disappearTo()`, as shown in the following snippet.

Following is how you should add the disappearing animation to the sample:

```java
@OnCreateTransition
static Transition onCreateTransition(ComponentContext c) {
  return Transition.create(SQUARE_KEY)
      .animate(AnimatedProperties.X)
      .appearFrom(0f)
      .animate(AnimatedProperties.ALPHA)
      .appearFrom(0f)
      .disappearTo(0f)
      .animate(AnimatedProperties.SCALE)
      .disappearTo(0.5f);
}
```

<video loop="true" autoplay="true" class="video" width="100%" height="500px" >
  <source type="video/webm" src={useBaseUrl("/videos/transitions/disappear.webm")}></source>
  <p>Your browser does not support the video element.</p>
</video>

Under the hood, in order to run a disappearing animation, the framework takes the following algorithm:

1. Pick up the *start* value from the mounted UI element that represents the `Component`.
2. Retrieve the *end* from the user-provided `disappearTo` value of transition definition.
3. Render the *after* layout, but instead of removing the UI element from screen right away, drive the value of `AnimatedProperty` to the *end*, and only then remove the UI element.

`ComponentC` is only present in the *before* tree.

**After**

```java
child = SolidColor.create(c)
    .color(YELLOW)
    .widthDip(80)
    .heightDip(80)
    .transitionKey(SQUARE_KEY);

Column.create(c)
    .child(child) // ComponentC is present and will be animated.
    .alignItems(YogaAlign.FLEX_END)
    .build();
```

**Before**

```java
child = null;

Column.create(c)
    .child(child) // ComponentC is null here
    .alignItems(YogaAlign.FLEX_END)
    .build();
```

:::info
It is important to understand that once the layout has been mounted (on step 3) a disappearing `Component` isn't a part of layout tree anymore. However the drawing order of all the UI element is defined by the layout tree. Hence the UI element for the disappearing `Component` will be drawn the last. In some rare cases (normally involving cross-fading elements), this may result in the rendering being different from what you would expect. In such cases, a change animation should be used instead.
