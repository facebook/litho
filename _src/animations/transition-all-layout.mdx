[`Transition.allLayout()`](pathname:///javadoc/com/facebook/litho/Transition.html#allLayout--) enables you to easily animate all layout changes without having to assign `transitionKeys` to all `Components`:

```java
@OnCreateTransition
static Transition onCreateTransition(ComponentContext c) {
  return Transition.allLayout().animator(ANIMATOR);
}
```

Note, that `Transition.allLayout()`:

1. Targets `AnimatedProperty.X`, `Y`, `HEIGHT` and `WIDTH` of all `Components` present in the layout tree.
2. Can be used to define [Change](transition-types.mdx#change-transitions) transitions only. To define the [Appear](transition-types.mdx#appear-transitions) and [Disappear](transition-types.mdx#disappear-transitions) transitions, `transitionKeys` still need to be assigned.
3. Could be used as a part of more [complex choreography](transition-choreography.mdx).

The following example can be found in `Litho Sample App`->`API Demos`->`Animated Badge`:

```java file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/java/animations/animatedbadge/AnimatedBadgeSpec.java start=start end=end
```

The following animation shows 'Animated Badge' in action.
