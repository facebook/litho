   * - Any existing [Effect] that is no longer present will be cleaned up
   * - Any [Effect] whose [Effect.shouldUpdate] returns `true` will be cleaned up
   * - When state tracking is enabled, any [Effect] that reads an updated [State] will also be
   *   cleaned up

   * Effects to run are determined by the following:
   * - All new effects will be run
   * - Any [Effect] present in the new generation, but was previously detached will be run
   *
   * Note that the returned [Runnable] must be called on the main thread.
   *
   * @return a [Runnable] that runs the incoming effects. Implementations should ensure that the
   *   effects are only ran once, even if the runnable is invoked multiple times.
