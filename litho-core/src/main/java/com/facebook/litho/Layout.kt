/**
 * A container component that owns the children it is given.
 *
 * A `Row` or a `Column` hands its children to flexbox. A `Layout` positions them itself: its layout
 * function measures the children, gives the container a size and places each child. Use it for
 * layouts flexbox cannot express, such as a pager whose pages sit at a computed stride, a split
 * pane sized by a dragged divider, or a header that collapses as another child scrolls.
 *
 * It is an ordinary component, returned from `render`:
 * ```kotlin
 * class MyRow(private val header: Component, private val body: Component) : KComponent() {
 *   override fun ComponentScope.render(): Component =
 *       Layout(header, body) { header, body, c -> … }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Pass a list for children that come from data. The one-, two- and three-child forms build the same
 * container and let a fixed set of children be named at the call site:
 * ```kotlin
 * Layout(items.map { Page(it).key(it.id) }) { measurables, c -> … }   // N children
 * Layout(avatar, name, timestamp) { avatar, name, timestamp, c -> … } // three, named
 * ```
 *
 * A layout that needs per-child values — an angle, an alignment, a column — reads them with
 * `measurable.layoutProps`, as [LayoutProps] classes its children set in their own `Style` with
 * `layoutProps`.
 *
 * **A container is unchanged only when its layout function and its `deps` are.** The Litho compiler
 * plugin fills in `deps` from what the layout lambda captures, so a lambda written at the call site
 * needs nothing more:
 * ```kotlin
 * Layout(header, body) { header, body, constraints -> … spacing … } // deps = arrayOf(spacing)
 * ```
 *
 * With `deps`, inferred or passed, the container is unchanged when the function is of the same
 * class and the deps are equivalent. An inferred set can be empty, for a lambda that captures
 * nothing or only values the plugin ignores, and `deps = emptyArray()` says the function depends on
 * nothing; either way the class alone decides. A layout function that isn't a lambda written at the
 * call site, such as an `object`, has no closure for the plugin to read, so its `deps` keep their
 * default and the function is compared with `equals`. So does every call compiled without the
 * plugin, where a lambda that captures values is a new instance and never unchanged.
 *
 * A child that renders nothing keeps its slot as an empty child that measures 0x0, so every child
 * has the index it was declared at and a function naming its children always gets them all.
 *
 * Give children a stable `key` when they come from data. Without one, a child's state is keyed by
 * its position among its same-type siblings, so inserting at the front hands the second child the
 * first child's state. That shows up as a video resuming at the wrong timestamp rather than as
 * something that looks like a bug.
 *
 * Children resolve into the parent's Litho tree rather than a nested one, so hook identity, prop
 * reconciliation, incremental mount and visibility keep working across them without forwarding
 * anything by hand.
 *
 * In a flexbox parent, a `Layout` is rounded to whole pixels as a `Column` is, to the nearest. A
 * component that measures its own content, such as one rendering with `RenderWithConstraints` or a
 * size spec, is rounded as text is, never narrower than it measured. So a `Layout` that replaces
 * one can come out 1 px narrower when its parent gives it a fractional width.
 *
 * A `Layout` mounts no content, so it gets a host of its own only when its `style` needs one.
 * `onClick`, `viewTag`, `focusable`, a shadow and a transition name each create a host, as on any
 * other component. Intercepting touch, cooperating with a nested scroll, or transforming children
 * per frame still needs whatever mechanism you use today.
 *
 * A container's `style` is what it tells its own parent, and the props the framework applies to any
 * node: size, padding, margin, background, and so on. Its padding and border are the one way it
 * reaches the children: the layout function works inside them, so they narrow the constraints it
 * receives. Anything else that configures the arrangement — spacing, alignment — the layout
 * function captures, or the component returning this `Layout` takes as a prop. A [LayoutProps] set
 * in it is read by this container's parent, not by this container.

   * Inheriting the default would compare nothing. [Component.isEquivalentProps] defers to
   * `ComponentUtils.hasEquivalentFields`, which only looks at fields annotated `@Comparable`, and
   * the Spec API's processor is what generates those onto `@Prop`s. A Kotlin component has none, so
   * every container would be equivalent to every other and a changed child would never reach the
   * screen. `KComponent` overrides this for the same reason.
   *
   * Two renders of one call site share the layout function's class even when what the lambda
   * captured changed, so the class alone would keep a container laid out against a stale value.
   * With [deps], the class and the deps decide: the deps hold everything the function captured.
   * When either side's deps kept their default, `NOT_INFERRED`, nothing says what its function
   * captured, so the function is compared with `equals`: a lambda or a plain class is the same only
   * as itself, an `object` always is, and a `data class` is when its properties are.
