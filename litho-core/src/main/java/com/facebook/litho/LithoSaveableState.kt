/**
 * Declares component state that can be restored by a lifecycle-backed host.
 *
 * The owning registry, component identity, hook call site, and optional [key] identify the value.
 * The [initializer] runs when no value has been retained or restored for that identity. Values
 * captured by [initializer] are initial inputs rather than observable dependencies; use [key] to
 * represent a different logical state owner.
 *
 * When this component leaves the committed tree, its provider is removed and its value is not
 * retained by this hook. A lifecycle or navigation host that replaces the whole ComponentTree can
 * retain the tree's registry explicitly so active values survive into the replacement tree.
 *
 * The [saver] must encode the value into a type supported by Android [android.os.Bundle]. The
 * default saver stores Bundle-compatible values directly. The factory and saver may run on a Litho
 * resolve thread and must not access Views or other main-thread-only objects.
 *
 * A root ComponentTree created with a [androidx.savedstate.SavedStateRegistryOwner] saves its
 * values under its root component's class and manual key:
 * - Two root trees with the same identity on screen at the same time are not saved; give them
 *   distinct manual keys with `key(...) { ... }`.
 * - A tree that replaces another of its identity, such as a new tree set on the same view, starts
 *   from initial values and is saved from then on.
 * - A tree built with [ComponentTree.Builder.withSaveableStateKey] is saved under that key instead,
 *   and the next tree with the key takes its values over, even while the screen is visible. Only
 *   the 32 most recently released keys keep their values.
 *
 * Nested ComponentTrees save inside their parent tree.
 *
 * Without an owning registry, this behaves like [useState]: the value lasts for the current
 * ComponentTree and is not restored after it is released.
