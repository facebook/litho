/**
 * A root ComponentTree's claim on saved state under the [SavedStateRegistryOwner] it was created
 * with.
 *
 * Values are saved in the narrower of the two owners: the lifecycle owner when it can save state
 * and isn't an Activity, otherwise the given store. An Activity outlives its Fragments, so saving a
 * Fragment's values there would bring a popped screen's values back. For a Fragment tree whose
 * lifecycle owner is `viewLifecycleOwner`, values go to the view owner's registry: AndroidX saves
 * it when the view goes onto the back stack and restores it into the next view, also after process
 * death, and drops it when the Fragment is popped.
 *
 * The tree's identity is its saveable-state key when it has one, otherwise its root component's
 * class and manual key, read when a component first reads saveable state. The values live in
 * [registry] for the tree's lifetime and are saved under that identity by the owner's
 * [ComponentTreeSaveableStateOwner].
