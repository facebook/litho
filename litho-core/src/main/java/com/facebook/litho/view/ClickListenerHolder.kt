/**
 * An additional click listener registered alongside a primary click handler via
 * `Style.additionalOnClick(key, …)`. [key] is an `@IdRes` that namespaces the registration so
 * different call-sites can layer independent listeners on the same view without colliding.
 *
 * Plain class (not `data class`) on purpose: [onClick] is a lambda and lambdas have no meaningful
 * value equality, so an auto-generated `equals`/`hashCode` would compare by reference identity
 * while pretending to be a value type — misleading. Reference equality from the default `Any`
 * `equals`/`hashCode` is honest.
