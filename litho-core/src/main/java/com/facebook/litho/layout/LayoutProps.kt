/**
 * A value a child carries for whichever `Layout` reads it: an angle, an alignment, a column.
 * Unrelated to `com.facebook.litho.LayoutProps`, the Yoga props a component sets on its own node.
 *
 * The class is the key. A layout declares a class for each value it reads, and a setter named for
 * its layout:
 * ```kotlin
 * private data class RadialPosition(val angle: Float, val radius: Dimen) : LayoutProps
 *
 * fun Style.radialPosition(angle: Float, radius: Dimen): Style =
 *     layoutProps(RadialPosition(angle, radius))
 *
 * // In the layout function
 * val position = child[RadialPosition::class] ?: RadialPosition(0f, 0.px)
 * ```
 *
 * Values are never merged. A later value replaces an earlier one whole, and an outer component's
 * replaces the one it wraps, as every other style prop does. Values that change independently
 * belong in classes of their own, so each is replaced on its own; values that must stay consistent
 * belong together in one class, so they are replaced together.
 *
 * Implement it on a final class: a data class, an enum, or a `@JvmInline value class` for a single
 * number. A value is stored and read under the type named at the call, so a setter or reader for a
 * sealed type names the sealed type, not one of its cases. A generic class is not a key: `Foo<A>`
 * and `Foo<B>` are one class at runtime.
 *
 * Values take part in `CommonProps` equivalence. Prefer immutable types with stable, meaningful
 * `equals` semantics, such as data classes. Lambdas, arrays, and plain classes compare by identity
 * unless deliberately wrapped; mutable values can also hide a change from equivalence. Identity is
 * appropriate only when it is part of the value's contract, as it is for reactive handles whose
 * updates are tracked separately.
