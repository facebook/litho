/**
 * Positions the children of a container.
 *
 * Yoga can express a row and a column. It cannot express a pager, where each page sits at a stride
 * the container computes; or a split pane, where a divider the user drags decides the sizes; or a
 * collapsing header, where one child's position depends on another's scroll offset. A layout
 * function is how a container says where its children go.
 *
 * Children remain part of the parent's Litho tree. They are not a nested tree, so incremental
 * mount, visibility and state all continue to work across them without the container forwarding
 * anything by hand.
 *
 * Sealed, so the only implementations are the arity shapes below. A container picks one by how many
 * parameters its lambda declares, and the constructor it matches says how many children it may
 * name, so handing a two-child function to a three-child container fails to compile.
 *
 * The intrinsic-size questions all have answers here, each of which runs the layout function and
 * reads the size back. Override one when the container knows its answer more cheaply — a pager is
 * one page wide however many pages it holds — which needs an object rather than a lambda. An
 * override receives the real children, and an [IntrinsicMeasureScope], which cannot measure them.
