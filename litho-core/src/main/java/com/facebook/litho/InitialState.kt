/**
 * The InitialStateContainer is a lookaside table used by a ComponentTree to create initial states
 * for Components. The idea is that the onCreateInitialState result for each component will be
 * cached and stored here so that we can guarantee it's not called multiple times on multiple
 * threads. We keep the initial states cached as long as there is a layout happening for the
 * ComponentTree. As soon as we detect that all in-flights layout have terminated we can clean up
 * the initial states cache.
 *
 * Locking discipline, as numbered invariants:
 * - **INV-1 (single monitor)**: every read or write of a [Slot]'s contents happens inside
 *   `synchronized(slot.lock)` for the slot returned by *this invocation's* [slotFor].
 * - **INV-2 (fetch-once)**: each public method calls [slotFor] exactly once, holds the result in a
 *   local, and never re-reads [slots] after acquiring the lock. Without this, a drain between the
 *   vend and the lock acquisition would let two threads hold different monitors over the same
 *   logical key.
 * - **INV-3 (co-drain)**: monitor and data are allocated together ([Slot]) and discarded together
 *   (`slots = null`), so a drain cannot go partial. Any future per-key cache belongs *inside*
 *   [Slot], never beside it. A thread still holding a pre-drain [Slot] keeps writing to it and its
 *   seed is discarded rather than resurrected into the new epoch -- safe only because a registered
 *   `StateHandler` keeps `pendingStateHandlers` non-empty and so prevents the drain.
