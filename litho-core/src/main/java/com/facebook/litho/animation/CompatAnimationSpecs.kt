 * mapping to stiffness and damping ratio is exact. The motion is equivalent within tolerance rather
 * than bit-identical: this runs the closed-form solver instead of the fixed-step integrator behind
 * `Transition`, and settles on slightly different thresholds.
 *
 * Under a dropped frame the two differ. `Transition` advances its spring by at most 64ms per frame,
 * so after a long frame it falls behind real time; this spec evaluates the full elapsed time. A
 * stateless spec cannot reproduce that cap, since it depends on how frames were spaced.
 *
 * [friction] must be positive: with no damping the spring never settles, which a finite spec cannot
