package com.facebook.litho.animation

import kotlin.time.Duration

/**
 * An immutable configuration that defines how an animation should behave.
 *
 * [AnimationSpec] is a lightweight, shareable description of animation parameters — spring
 * stiffness, tween duration, easing curve, etc. It does not hold animation state. When an animation
 * needs to run, [createAnimator] produces an [Animator] bound to specific initial conditions.
 *
 * ## Spec vs Animator
 * - **[AnimationSpec]** = recipe (what kind of animation, reusable)
 * - **[Animator]** = computation engine (bound to specific from/to values, time-driven)
 *
 * ## Built-in Specs
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * spring<Float>(stiffness = Stiffness.Low, dampingRatio = DampingRatio.MediumBouncy)
 * tween<Float>(duration = 300.ms, easing = Easing.FastOutSlowIn)
 * keyframes<Float>(duration = 500.ms) { ... }
 * snap<Float>()
 * repeatable<Float>(iterations = 3, animation = tween())
 * ```
 *
 * ## Type Safety
 *
 * [AnimationSpec] is parameterized by the value type [T]. The [TypeConverter] is provided at
 * animator creation time — not at spec construction time — so a single spec like `spring<Float>()`
 * is both lightweight and type-safe without needing to carry a converter reference.
 *
 * ## Interruption
 *
 * When an animation is interrupted mid-flight, the current per-component velocity can be captured
 * from the running [Animator] and passed as [initialVelocity] to a new animator. This enables
 * smooth retargeting without velocity discontinuities.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * // Interruption with per-component velocity preservation
 * val velocity = FloatTypeConverter.newVector()
 * runningAnimator.getVelocity(elapsedNanos, velocity)
 * val newAnimator = spec.createAnimator(
 *     initialValue = currentValue,
 *     targetValue = newTarget,
 *     typeConverter = FloatTypeConverter,
 *     initialVelocity = velocity,
 * )
 * ```
 *
 * @param T The type of value this spec animates.
 * @see Animator
 * @see TypeConverter

  /**
   * Creates an [Animator] configured with the given initial conditions.
   *
   * The returned animator is a stateless computation engine that can be queried at any elapsed time
   * to produce the animated value, velocity, and completion status.
   *
   * @param initialValue The value at the start of the animation.
   * @param targetValue The value at the end of the animation.
   * @param typeConverter Converts between [T] and [AnimationVector] for internal computation.
   * @param initialVelocity A read-only snapshot of the starting per-component velocity in
   *   float-space units per second, shaped by [typeConverter]. Defaults to `null` (at rest).
   *   Non-null values are primarily useful for spring animations during interruption, where the
   *   previous animation's per-component velocity carries over for smooth retargeting. Non-spring
   *   specs may ignore it.
   * @return An [Animator] that computes values for this animation over time.
