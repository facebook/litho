  /**
   * Measures a component, reusing the previous measurement from [DiffNode] if the specs match
   * exactly.
   *
   * ## Measure cache behavior
   *
   * The cache reuses the previous result only when `lastWidthSpec == widthSpec && lastHeightSpec ==
   * heightSpec`. This is a strict equality check — any change in the spec value forces
   * re-measurement, even when the result would be identical.
   *
   * This is stricter than necessary. Yoga's internal `YGNodeCanUseCachedMeasurement` implements
   * **spec-compatible** matching: if the previous measured size fits within the new constraint, the
   * cached result is reused.
   *
   * ### When strict equality causes unnecessary re-measurement
   *
   * When a parent's dimension is animated, Yoga passes a new AT_MOST constraint to children every
   * frame. Components whose output doesn't depend on the AT_MOST value (e.g., text that wraps based
   * on width and is far shorter than the height constraint) produce identical results but are
   * re-measured because the specs differ.
   *
   * ### Spec-compatible matching and its edge cases
   *
   * A spec-compatible check would compare the previous *measured size* against the new *constraint*
   * rather than comparing specs directly.
   *
   * Compatibility rules (can skip re-measurement when):
   * - **EXACTLY → EXACTLY**: `oldSize == newSize`
   * - **AT_MOST → AT_MOST**: `measuredSize < min(oldSize, newSize)`
   * - **Any mode change**: never — must re-measure
   *
   * How these rules handle different component behaviors (AT_MOST → AT_MOST):
   * - **Intrinsic size** (e.g., text h=53, AT_MOST 1000→1200): `53 < 1000` → skip. Correct — text
   *   doesn't depend on the constraint.
   * - **Fills constraint** (e.g., scroll h=1000, AT_MOST 1000→1200): `1000 < 1000` is false →
   *   re-measure. Correct — the scroll would grow to 1200.
   * - **Coincidence** (e.g., component naturally h=1000, AT_MOST 1000→1200): `1000 < 1000` is false
   *   → re-measure. Conservative — the result would be the same (h=1000), but we can't distinguish
   *   this from the fills-constraint case without knowing the component's preferred size.
   * - **Fraction of constraint** (e.g., `h = maxHeight / 2` = 500, AT_MOST 1000→1200): `500 < 1000`
   *   → skip. **Wrong** — the result should be 600. No external cache can detect this; such
   *   components should override [Component.shouldAlwaysRemeasure].
   *
   * Key design decisions:
   * - **Strict `<` (not `<=`)**: If `measuredSize == constraintSize`, the component may have been
   *   clamped — it wanted to be larger but was limited by the constraint. A different constraint
   *   could produce a different result.
   * - **No cross-mode transitions** (e.g., EXACTLY → AT_MOST, AT_MOST → EXACTLY): Under EXACTLY,
   *   the component is forced to a specific size. Under AT_MOST, it can choose freely up to the
   *   limit. A component may prefer a completely different size when the mode changes, so the
   *   cached result from one mode is not reliable for a different mode.
   *
   * Edge cases that no external cache can handle:
   * - **Fraction of constraint**: A component that computes its size as a fraction of available
   *   space (e.g., `height = maxHeight / 2`) measures smaller than the constraint but would produce
   *   a different result under a different constraint. Such components should override
   *   [Component.shouldAlwaysRemeasure].
   * - **Layout data depends on constraint**: A component whose measured size is the same but whose
   *   [LithoLayoutResult.layoutData] would differ under new constraints. Rare but possible with
   *   custom primitives.
