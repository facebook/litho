/**
 * A structured key that identifies a hook call site within a component's render method.
 *
 * Each hook call is identified by a compiler-generated call-site id, a local identity, and a parent
 * pointer. Ordinary hooks use their runtime occurrence index as the local identity. [withNewScope]
 * replaces that occurrence index with a developer-provided key so hooks in a collection remain
 * attached to the same item when the collection is reordered.
 *
 * The [id] field packs two 32-bit integers into a single Long (see [IntSize] for a similar
 * pattern):
 * - **High 32 bits**: the call-site id — a stable hash of the enclosing callable identity and its
 *   local @Hook-call ordinal.
 * - **Low 32 bits**: the runtime index — how many times this call-site has been entered within its
 *   parent hook invocation (distinguishes calls in loops).
 *
 * When interning is enabled (see [create]'s `intern` parameter), [create] returns the same object
 * for the same (id, parent) combination across render passes, avoiding repeated allocations for
 * deterministic hook call trees. This also enables fast referential equality checks in map lookups.
 *
 * @param id Packed call-site id (high 32) and runtime index (low 32) for an ordinary hook key.
 * @param parent The HookKey of the enclosing hook if this call is nested inside another @Hook
 *   function, or null if at the top level of a component's render method.

   * The recursive form this replaced walked the whole parent chain on every call, and hash
   * containers call [hashCode] on every `get` *and* every `put`, so a deep key paid that walk on
   * every lookup. Caching is safe because both [id] and [parent] are immutable; [children] is a
   * cache and deliberately not part of the identity.
   *
   * Lazy rather than eager because with interning off every `create` allocates a fresh key, and
   * most of those are never used as a map key -- eager hashing would be pure waste for them. `0`
   * doubles as "not yet computed"; a key whose real hash is 0 simply recomputes, which is correct
   * and rare. Unsynchronised on purpose: concurrent callers race to write the same value, and an
   * `Int` write cannot tear.
