Litho's primary use case is *RecyclerViews* with complex content as it delivers
great scroll performance even with complex items with a wide variety of
content, which is quite challenging to achieve using traditional Android views.

You might also consider adopting Litho simply for its declarative API for
building user interfaces. Litho's functional programming model with a
unidirectional data flow tends to be much easier to reason about even as your
product gets more complex.

Very dynamic UIs with animations and gestures are currently hard to implement
in Litho. New APIs for layout transitions and gestures in Litho are coming
soon.
