Litho provides predefined APIs to support a range of use cases where components
require callbacks when the on-screen position relative to the visible viewport changes.

## Types of Visibility Callbacks

The framework currently supports six types of Visibility callbacks:

- [Visible](pathname:///javadoc/com/facebook/litho/VisibleEvent.html): Invoked when at least 1
pixel of the Component is visible. If the component mounts some content, then the `event.content`
will be a reference to that content.
- [Invisible](pathname:///javadoc/com/facebook/litho/InvisibleEvent.html): Invoked when the
Component no longer has any pixels on the screen.
- [Focused](pathname:///javadoc/com/facebook/litho/FocusedVisibleEvent.html): Invoked when
 either the Component occupies at least 50% of the viewport or if the Component is smaller than
 half the viewport, when it is fully visible.
- [Unfocused](pathname:///javadoc/com/facebook/litho/UnfocusedVisibleEvent.html): Invoked
 when the Component is no longer focused, such as if it's not fully visible and does not occupy at
least half the viewport.
- [Full Impression](pathname:///javadoc/com/facebook/litho/FullImpressionVisibleEvent.html):
If the Component is smaller than the viewport, this callback is invoked when the entire Component
is visible in the viewport. If the Component is bigger than the viewport, then just covering the
viewport won't invoke this callback: it will be invoked when all the edges have passed through the
viewport once.
- [Visibility Changed](pathname:///javadoc/com/facebook/litho/VisibilityChangedEvent.html): Invoked
when the visible bounds of the Component change. The event object will tell you the visible top
and left coordinate, and the current visible width and height of the content.

## Usage

The following example illustrates setting visibility callbacks on a component.

``` kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/documentation/VisibilityHandlingExampleComponent.kt start=start_example end=end_example
```

:::tip
Visibility change callbacks should be used with particular care since they will be invoked on every
frame while scrolling. No heavy work should be done inside the visibility changed callbacks.
'Visible', 'Invisible', 'Focused', 'Unfocused', and 'Full Impression' are recommended over visibility changed
whenever possible.

### Custom visibility percentage

By default, `VisibleEvent` is triggered when at least 1 pixel of the Component is visible. In some
cases you may want to listen to custom visibility changes and perform an action when the Component
is only partially visible. You can specify a ratio of the Component width or height for the visibility
callback to be dispatched by using `visibleHeightRatio` and `visibleWidthRatio` props when specifying a visibility handler.

:::info
Currently, the Kotlin API does not expose `visibleHeightRatio` and `visibleWidthRatio`. Please use the Codengen APIs.
if you need to leverage that.
:::

For the example above, a Visibility Event is dispatched when at least 80% of the Component's
height and 10% of the Component's width is visible. When the Component's visible percentage
changes to less than 80% of total height, an invisible event will be dispatched. If not specified,
the default width or height ratio is 1f.

## Changing LithoView Visibility

There are cases when the visibility callback needs to be invoked on the LithoView components because the
LithoView's visibility changed but did not receive any callbacks to inform it of this change.
For example, when an activity is added to the back stack, covering the current UI. For such cases, Litho
provides the [LithoLifecycleProvider API](#litholifecycleprovider-api) to notify LithoView about changes
in its visibility, and to dispatch correct events to components inside.

### LithoLifecycleProvider API

The `LithoLifecycleProvider` API can be used to inform LithoView about  changes in its visibility state.
`LithoLifecycleProvider.moveToLifecycle()` method should be called from `Fragment.setUserVisibleHint()`
or `onResume()/onPause()` methods of `Activity` or `Fragment`.

```java
public interface LithoLifecycleProvider {

  // Should be called to inform Litho that its visiblity state has changed
  void moveToLifecycle(LithoLifecycle lithoLifecycle);

}
```

#### Valid LithoLifecycleProvider states:

* `HINT_INVISIBLE` - indicates that the lifecycle provider is considered to be not visible on
screen. Lifecycle observers can perform operations which are associated with invisibility status.
An example of moving to a `HINT_INVISIBLE` state is when a fragment goes from **Resumed** to **Paused**
because the app was backgrounded. The **invisible** events will be dispatched to all Components inside
the `LithoView` that were visible.

* `HINT_VISIBLE` - indicates that the lifecycle provider is considered visible on screen.
Lifecycle observers can perform operations that are associated with visibility status. An example
of moving to `HINT_VISIBLE` state is when a fragment goes from **Paused** to **Resumed** because the
app was foregrounded. **Visible ** events will be dispatched to all Components inside the `LithoView`
which meet the visibility criteria.

* `DESTROYED` - the final state of a lifecycle provider. Lifecycle observers can perform
operations associated with releasing resources. An example of moving to `DESTROYED` state is when
the hosting Activity is destroyed. The `ComponentTree` associated with the `LithoView` will be
released; all the **invisible** events will be dispatched to all Components that were visible,
and all content will be unmounted.

#### Listening to a `LithoLifecycleProvider` state changes:

You can register a `LithoView` to listen to state changes of a `LithoLifecycleProvider` instance when you create it:

```java
final LithoView lithoView = LithoView.create(c, component, lithoLifecycleProvider);
```

### Android AOSP implementation

This is an implementation of `LithoLifecycleProvider` which has the state tied to that of an AOSP
[LifecycleOwner](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle#lco).

* `LifecycleOwner` in `ON_PAUSE` state will move the `AOSPLithoLifecycleProvider` to `HINT_INVISIBLE` state

* `LifecycleOwner` in `ON_RESUME` state will move the `AOSPLithoLifecycleProvider` to `HINT_VISIBLE` state

* `LifecycleOwner` in `ON_DESTROY` state will move the `AOSPLithoLifecycleProvider` to `DESTROYED` state

Use `AOSPLithoLifecycleProvider` when you want to associate a LithoView's visibility status with the
lifecycle of a Fragment, Activity or custom LifecycleOwner, where **Resumed** means the LithoView is
on screen and **Paused** means the LithoView is hidden.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/java/lifecycle/LifecycleDelegateActivity.kt start=start_example_lifecycleprovider end=end_example_lifecycleprovider
```

### Handling custom state changes

`AOSPLithoLifecycleProvider` covers most of the common cases, but there are scenarios where a
LifecycleOwner's state doesn't match what we see on screen, as shown in the following examples:

* Fragments in a ViewPager, where Fragments for the previous and next pages are prepared and in a
**Resumed** state before they're actually visible.

* Adding a Fragment on top of another Fragment doesn't move the first Fragment to a **Paused**
state, and there's no indication that it's no longer visible to the user.

When you need to handle these state changes manually, you can use `LithoLifecycleProviderDelegate`,
a generic `LithoLifecycleProvider` implementation, to change state when appropriate.


#### ViewPager example

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/java/lifecycle/ScreenSlidePageFragment.kt start=start_example_lifecycleprovider end=end_example_lifecycleprovider
```

#### Fragment Transaction example

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/java/lifecycle/LifecycleFragment.kt start=start_example_lifecycleprovider end=end_example_lifecycleprovider
```

### Nested Component Trees

The Litho components for building Lists (`Section`s, `VerticalScrollSpec`, `HorizontalScrollSpec`) create
hierarchies of nested `ComponentTree`s:

* A ComponentTree at the root of the hierarchy, encapsulating the entire list (associated with a root LithoView)
* A ComponentTree for each item in the List (associated with a LithoView child of the root LithoView)

If the root LithoView is subscribed to listen to a `LithoLifecycleProvider`, then all nested
Component Trees / child LithoViews will listen to the outer `LithoLifecycleProvider` too and will
receive the correct information about visibility/destroyed state.

:::info
The section below contains information about deprecated APIs. Please consider using
`LithoLifecycleProvider` for manually informing a `LithoView` about visibility changes.
:::

## (Deprecated) setVisibilityHint

After calling `LithoView.setVisibilityHint(false)`, the LithoView will consider itself not visible
and will ignore any requests to mount until `setVisibilityHint(true)` is called.
You may still unmount the entire LithoView content by calling `unmountAll` if the visibility hint
was set to false.

Resetting the visibility hint to true after it was set to false will also trigger a mount pass, in
case the visible bounds changed while the LithoView was ignoring mount requests.

Example usage:
```java
// To dispatch visible/focused events as necessary on all components inside this LithoView
LithoView.setVisibilityHint(true);

// To dispatch invisible/unfocused events as necessary on all components inside this LithoView
LithoView.setVisibilityHint(false);
```
