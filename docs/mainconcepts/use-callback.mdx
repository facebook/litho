`useCallback` is a hook that allows a parent to pass a child component a callback which:
- maintains referential equality across multiple layout passes
- is updated to have the latest parent props and state, even if the child doesn't re-render.

## Example

In the following code, we have a parent component which renders a list of children via a Collection.
Let's say we also want this parent to implement multi-select behavior, meaning on click, a row can be marked as selected/de-selected.
We will store the state of which components are currently selected in the parent, and the parent will pass a lambda to the child to allow that state to be updated when a row is clicked.

When the first row is clicked, it will update the state in the parent via an onClick lambda. At this point, we ideally want to re-render only that row since that's the only row whose UI will beupdated, i.e. to a selected state.
However, that means the rest of the children will still have that original onClick lambda set on them: if that lambda captured props/state, then invoking it will operate on stale props/state! In this case, that means selecting a second row will de-select the first one which is incorrect.

An alternative is to always re-render all children whenever the list of selected items changes.
This is effective in that it will make sure all children have a lambda capturing the latest props/state, however it's inefficient since it re-renders all children even though their UI doesn't appear different.

`useCallback` tries to give the best of both worlds: it doesn't cause children to re-render, and
also gives a mechanism for them to invoke a lambda that has captured the latest props and state

```

:::note
The callback that will be invoked by the function returned by `useCallback` is updated when a new layout has been committed **on the main thread**. This means that `useCallback` should only be used with events that will also be invoked from the main thread, e.g. onClick.
