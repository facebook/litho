The `useLiveData` hook provides support to observe `LiveData` updates inside a `Component`.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/observability/UseLiveDataComponent.kt  start=start_example end=end_example
```

This hook will start observing the given `LiveData` and return its latest value every time it changes. The values observed are internally represented as Litho's `State`, hence it will trigger a  new layout calculation for any `LiveData` value change.

### Integrating Litho with the `LifecycleOwner`

A core principle for `LiveData` observation is the `LifecycleOwner`, which defines at what points the Observer can listen to value changes. In order to use `useLiveData`, you **must** create your `LithoView` with the `AOSPLithoLifecycleProvider` and  pass the appropriate `LifecycleOwner` to it. This can be done as shown in the sample below:
:::

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/documentation/LithoViewCreationFragment.kt  start=start_example end=end_example
```


The `LiveData` observation will respect the `LifecycleOwner` lifecycle. Therefore, it will not  consume updates if the `Lifecycle.State` is not at least `Lifecycle.State.STARTED`, and it will
automatically stop being observed if the given `LifecycleOwner` moves to `Lifecycle.State.DESTROYED`.

### Dependencies

In Gradle, you should add the following dependency to the `build.gradle` file:

<VersionedCodeBlock language="groovy" code={`
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.facebook.litho:litho-live-data-kotlin:{{site.lithoVersion}}'
}
`} />

<FbInternalOnly>

In Buck, you should add the following dependency to your BUCK file:

```buck
//fbandroid/libraries/components/litho-live-data/src/main/kotlin/com/facebook/litho:live-live-data
```
</FbInternalOnly>
