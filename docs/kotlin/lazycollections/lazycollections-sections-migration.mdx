title: Sections Migration Guide
---

Lazy Collections offer a cleaner api for building scrolling lists. Advantages over Sections include:
* No code generation.
* Simple inline declaration (similar to a Row/Column).
* List items have direct access to the containing components props and state.
* Automatic diffing of content updates.

This page provides guidance for migrating an existing list rendered with Sections to [lazy collections](lazycollections.mdx). This will involve:

1. Replacing the component that renders the section tree with a lazy collection component.
2. Adding each component from the section tree as a child of the lazy collection.
3. Migrating any event handlers or state.

## Replace the `RecyclerCollectionComponent`

Sections are typically rendered by a `RecyclerCollectionComponent`:

```kotlin
val component = RecyclerCollectionComponent.create(c)
  .section(...)
  .build()
```

This should be replaced with a lazy collection component, for example `LazyList`. For information on migrating the `RecyclerCollectionComponent`'s configuration options, see the [Layout and Styling](lazycollections-layout.mdx) page.

```kotlin
val component = LazyList {
  // Content will be added inline
}
```

:::info
Lazy collections can only be used inside `KComponent`s. If you are migrating a Spec component then first convert it to a `KComponent` or implement the lazy collection inside a `KComponent` container.
:::


Next, you need to migrate the content from the Section into the lazy collection, as detailed below.

## Migrating `GroupSectionSpec`

A `GroupSectionSpec` includes an `onCreateChildren` function that creates a list of `SingleComponentSection` and `DataDiffSection` children.

The first step is to migrate each `SingleComponentSection`. The following `GroupSectionSpec` renders two components as `SingleComponentSection`s:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/documentation/SimpleGroupSectionSpec.kt start=start_example end=end_example
```

The component from each `SingleComponentSection` should be added as a child to the lazy collection. Lazy collections supports `KComponent` and `Spec` children. `SingleComponentSection` config options are available as parameters on child, such as `isSticky`.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/collection/SectionsMigrations.kt start=start_simple_group end=end_simple_group
```

Next, consider a list rendered with a `DataDiffSection`

## Migrating `DataDiffSection`

A `DataDiffSection` defines how a list should be rendered. They can be defined as a child in a `GroupSectionSpec`, or directly on a `RecyclerCollectionComponent`, and require the following event handlers:

* `renderEventHandler` - render a list item.
* `onCheckIsSameItemEventHandler`  - Used to determine if items have the same identity.
* `onCheckIsSameContentEventHandler` - Used to determine if items have updated content.

Consider the following `GroupSectionSpec` that contains a `DataDiffSection` to render a list of the following type:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/documentation/ListSectionSpec.kt start=start_data_type end=end_data_type
```

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/documentation/ListSectionSpec.kt start=start_example end=end_example
```

A component for each list item should be added the lazy collection as a child. The component can be copied from the RenderEvent’s `ComponentRenderInfo` `component` parameter.

The child `id` parameter should be a unique and consistent across renders and will likely be the value that is compared in `onCheckIsSameItem`. See the [guidelines for child ids](lazycollections-working-with-updates.mdx#child-identity).

It is not necessary to migrate the checks from `onCheckIsSameContent` as the lazy collection will automatically compare the child component props. However, additional steps may be required to eliminate unnecessary layouts if child takes props that do not provide an `equals()`. For more information, see the [Avoiding Unnecessary Layouts](lazycollections-working-with-updates.mdx##avoiding-unecessary-layouts) page.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/collection/SectionsMigrations.kt start=start_list end=end_list
```

## Migrating Event Handlers

Event handlers that are defined as `@OnEvent` function (such as visibility or click handling) can be passed as lambdas to the appropriate Style function. Note that using lambdas as props could cause [unnecessary updates](lazycollections-working-with-updates.mdx#using-lambdas-as-props), so they should be wrapped in a `useCallback` hook.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/documentation/EventHandlerSectionSpec.kt start=start_example end=end_example
```

Migrating the above Section to a lazy collection's yields:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/collection/SectionsMigrations.kt start=start_event_handler end=end_event_handler
```
## Migrating Section State

State managed by a `Section` should be moved into the component that manages the lazy collection. You may consider defining your lazy collection inside a dedicated `KComponent` so that it can maintain its own state.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/documentation/StateSectionSpec.kt start=start_example end=end_example
```

Migrating the above Section to a lazy collections yields:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/collection/SectionsMigrations.kt start=start_state end=end_state
```
