# Product and Feature Documentation Template

This is a template for general product and feature documentation.

## What to do

1. Understand the [overall template](./TEMPLATE-INFORMATION.md).
1. Copy all the contents of this directory to your repo. This template uses Jekyll, the backend rendering engine for GitHub pages. You can have these docs in a root of a GitHub repo on the `master` branch, in a `docs` folder of a repo on the `master` branch, or you can have them as the root directly on a `gh-pages` branch of a repo. GitHub will [automatically serve up the content](https://github.com/blog/2228-simpler-github-pages-publishing).

  > If you do not want as much automation, you can put this template anywhere in your repo on whatever branch; then use a script to copy the static generated markup (from the `_site` folder) into the gh-pages branch.

1. Rename `EXAMPLE-README-FOR-RUNNING-DOCS.md` to `README.md`.
1. Rename `EXAMPLE-CONTRIBUTING.md` to `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
1. Rename `EXAMPLE-LICENSE` to `LICENSE`. Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 is the standard for documentation.

## Example Template Rendering

Here is what the example landing page may look like (with your logo, of course):

and here is what you may see when you scroll down from the landing page (with actual, real content,  
of course):
