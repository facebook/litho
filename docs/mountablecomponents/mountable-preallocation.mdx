title: Content Pooling
---

When a Mountable Component is being mounted, its content (View or Drawable) needs to be either initialized or reused from the recycling pool. If the pool is empty, a new instance will be created at that time, which might keep the UI thread too busy and drop one or more frames. To mitigate that, the Litho framework can pre-allocate a few instances and put them in the recycling pool to improve performance.

:::note
Content pooling is especially recommended for Mountable Components that inflate a complex View, which is time-consuming to create from scratch.

## Configuring pools

In order to configure content pools, the `SimpleMountable` implementation should override methods from the `ContentAllocator` interface which the abstract class SimpleMountable implements.

The `ContentAllocator` interface contains a few methods to configure the pool behaviour:

* `canPreallocate()` - enables pre-allocation for this Mountable Component (disabled by default)
* `poolSize()` - defines the number of instances for the Litho framework to pre-allocate (default value is three)
* `createRecyclingPool()` - can be overridden to create a custom pool (a default pool will be created if not overridden)
* `isRecyclingDisabled()` - can be overridden to disable recycling for the mount content (if this method returns true, all other methods listed above are ignored)

:::tip
If creating new instances of the content is time-consuming but not very memory-consuming, it's recommended to keep the pool size high.

If there are memory concerns (especially for memory-consuming content), smaller pool sizes are recommended, or pooling can be disabled altogether by returning true from `isRecyclingDisabled()`.

## Pre-allocation example

In order for mount content to be pre-allocated, at least the `canPreallocate()` method should be overridden to return `true`. Override `poolSize()` to configure the amount of items in the pool, as shown in the example below:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/mountables/SampleTextInput.kt start=start_preallocation_example end=end_preallocation_example
```

For the SampleTextInput component example above, ten instances of EditText will be created and pre-allocated in the recycling pool.
