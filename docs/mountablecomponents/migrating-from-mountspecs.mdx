This page outlines the process of migrating from [MountSpecs](../codegen/mount-specs.md) to [Mountable Components](mountable-component.mdx).

Unlike MountSpecs, Mountable Components consist of two separate pieces:

* `MountableComponent.render()` - a method that returns a `Mountable` and `Style` that will be applied to it.
* `Mountable` - an object that hosts the logic for measuring, creation, and setting properties on the mount content (a view or a drawable).

The following two sections contain information on how to migrate MountSpec static lifecycle methods into a Mountable Component `render()` and the `Mountable` it returns. The [Cheatsheet](mountable-cheatsheet.mdx) can also be consulted for a set of links for the migration of individual aspects of existing code.

## Setup - Adding Dependencies

To use the Kotlin Litho API, you'll need to add the following dependencies into your BUCK file:

```python title="BUCK"
deps = [
    "//fbandroid/libraries/components:litho_core_kotlin",
    "//fbandroid/libraries/components/litho-widget-kotlin/src/main/kotlin/com/facebook/litho/kotlin/widget:widget", # for widgets
],
```

More details on the setup steps are outlined in the [Introduction and Setup](../kotlin/setup-and-intro.mdx) page.

## Migrating parts belonging to Mountable Component `render()` method

The subsections below outline how to migrate the parts of a MountSpec that will be hosted by the Mountable Component. This includes Props and Common Props, useState and other [Hooks](../kotlin/hooks-for-spec-developers.mdx), Accessibility, Event Handling, and some other MountSpec static lifecycle methods.

### Migrating Props and Common Props

Similar to [KComponents](../kotlin/setup-and-intro.mdx/#props), Props are now just `val` properties on the `MountableComponent`, and `@PropDefaults` become default values of those `val` properties.

Common Props can be set using the `Style` object which the `MountableComponent` returns from `render()` method on the `MountableRenderResult` object. You can find more information on `Style` and how to work with it [here](../kotlin/setup-and-intro.mdx/#common-props).

### Migrating State and some other lifecycle methods

As with KComponents, most of the APIs implemented with lifecycle methods in the Mount Specs API (such as @OnCreateInitialState and @OnAttached) have hooks equivalents in the Kotlin API.

Those Hooks can be used in the `render()` method of the `MountableComponent`.

More information on how to migrate Hooks can be found [here](../kotlin/hooks-for-spec-developers.mdx).

### Migrating Accessibility

Accessibility for Mountable Components is implemented using the `Style` object. You can find out more about how to implement A11Y for Mountable Components [here](accessibility.mdx).

### Migrating event handling

Event Handling migration works in the same way as for KComponents (for details, see the [Event Handling](../kotlin/event-handling.mdx) page).

### Migrating @OnPrepare and @OnLoadStyle lifecycle methods

MountableComponents do not provide a `@OnPrepare` lifecycle method to move heavy operations off the UI thread before the layout calculation is performed. Instead, such operations should take place in the Mountable Component's `render()` method: the result can be passed to the `Mountable` as its `val` property. Therefore, in MountableComponents, there's no equivalent of [inter-stage inputs and outputs](../codegen/mount-specs.md/#inter-stage-inputs-and-outputs).

Similar to `@OnPrepare`, `@OnLoadStyle` lifecycle method's content should also migrate to be a part of MountableComponent's `render()` method.

## Migrating parts belonging to the `Mountable` object

The subsections below outline how to migrate the parts of a MountSpec that will be hosted by the `Mountable`. This includes logic to measure, create (and optionally pool), and bind the content, as well as `DynamicValues` and `Controllers` - a mechanism that replaces `@OnTrigger` static lifecycle method.

### Migrating @OnMeasure and @OnBoundsDefined

For MountSpecs, there are 2 measurement-related methods that are optional - @OnMeasure and @OnBoundsDefined.

Static annotated @OnMeasure method could be used to define how a component should be measured during layout calculation. If width and height was explicitly set on the component, it would not be run at all.

The second method, @OnBoundsDefined could [receive outputs](../codegen/mount-specs.md/#inter-stage-inputs-and-outputs) from @OnMeasure and would run after layout calculation, in order to carry out additional operations after final size of the component is known, but before the component is mounted. If @OnBoundsDefined method is included in the MountSpec, it is guaranteed to run once the sizes of the component has been calculated.

Mountable measuring works in a significantly different way - there's only 1 method, `Mountable.measure()`, which runs at least one time, and can be run multiple times in a single layout pass (similarly to Android's `View.measure()`).

Additionally, `Mountable.measure()` receives the `LayoutContext`, width and height constraints, and any previously calculated layout data. The method should return a `MeasureResult` that tells the Litho framework the width and height the content requires and, optionally, any layout data which will be passed to `mount()` and `unmount()` methods and to all the `Binders`. This is different from @OnMeasure static annotated method, where the sizes needed to be set on Size parameter object instead.

When translating a MountSpec containing both @OnMeasure and @OnBoundsDefined, the logic needs to be merged into a single `measure()` method - there's no need to pass outputs from @OnMeasure to @OnBoundsDefined.

:::note
For MountSpecs that did not implement @OnMeasure nor @OnBoundsDefined at all, `Mountable.measure()` can leverage `MeasureResult.fromSpecs()` method to set return the appropriate sizes.

### Migrating @OnCreateContent

`@OnCreateMountContent` lifecycle method's equivalent for Mountable is the `createContent()` method.

More information on Mountable content creation can be found [here](mountable.mdx/#content-creation).

class MyMountable : SimpleMountable<ImageView>(RenderType.VIEW) {

 override fun createContent(context: Context): ImageView = ImageView(context)

 ...
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Migrating content pooling and pre-allocation

For Mountable, instead of static annotated methods or @MountSpec annotation parameters, it's the `ContentAllocator` interface that SimpleMountable implements, which can be used to configure the recycling pool and pre-allocation for content.

Instead of specifying `canPreallocate` and `poolSize` parameters on the @MountSpec annotation, 'canPreallocate()' and 'poolSize()' methods should be overridden. `ContentAllocator` interface also contains various other methods that can be overridden to configure content recycling.

More information on Mountable content pooling can be found [here](mountable.mdx).

public class MyComponentSpec {

```kotlin
class MyMountable : SimpleMountable<View>(RenderType.VIEW) {

 override fun canPreallocate(): Boolean = true

 override fun poolSize(): Int = 1

 ...
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Migrating Binding and Mounting (properties setting) - @OnMount, @OnBind, @OnUnbind, @OnUnmount, and @OnShouldUpdate

For MountSpecs, @OnMount and @OnBind static annotated methods [could be used to set properties on content](../codegen/mount-specs.md/#mount-spec-component-lifecycle), along with matching @OnUnmount and @OnUnbind to unset properties.

In `SimpleMountable`, the equivalent of those two pairs of methods is a single `mount()` method to set the properties, and a matching `unmount()` method to unset them.

Therefore, the contents of @OnMount and @OnBind should be merged into a single `mount()` method when migrating to SimpleMountable. Similarly, @OnUnbind and @OnUnmount should be merged to form an `unmount()` method (in that particular order).

More information on mounting and unmounting content properties can be found on the [Lifecycle of a SimpleMountable](mountable.mdx/#mounting-and-unmounting-content-properties) page.

`SimpleMountable` also contains the `shouldUpdate()` method, which can help to avoid remeasuring and remounting upon updates if the properties of interest have not changed. It represents an [equivalent for @ShouldUpdate](../codegen/mount-specs.md/#shouldupdate) static annotated method present in MountSpecs.

    editText.setHint(hint);
  }

  @OnUnmount
  static void onUnmount(
      ComponentContext c, EditText editText) {
    editText.setHint("");
  }

  @ShouldUpdate
  static boolean shouldUpdate(@Prop(optional = true) Diff<CharSequence> hint) {
    if (!ObjectsCompat.equals(hint.getPrevious(), hint.getNext())) {
      return true;
    }

    return false;
  }

  ...
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="mountable_tab">

```kotlin
class MyMountable : SimpleMountable<EditText>(RenderType.VIEW) {

  override fun mount(c: Context, content: EditText, layoutData: Any?) {
    content.hint = hint
  }

  override fun unmount(c: Context, content: EditText, layoutData: Any?) {
    content.hint = ""
  }

  override fun shouldUpdate(
      newMountable: SimpleMountable<EditText>,
      currentLayoutData: Any?,
      nextLayoutData: Any?
  ): Boolean {
    newMountable as MyMountable
    return newMountable.hint != hint
  }

  ...
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Migrating @OnBindDynamicValue using bindTo API

For Mountable, [DynamicValues](../animations/dynamic-props.mdx) can be implemented using the BindTo API.

For more information and a step-by-step example, see the [BindTo - Dynamic Values API](mountable-bindto.mdx) page.

### Migrating @OnTrigger using Controllers Pattern

In MountSpecs, @OnTrigger static annotated methods and `Handle` could be used to [trigger events with handles](../codegen/trigger-events.md).

To implement equivalent behaviour in Mountable, Controller pattern should be used instead.

For more information and a step-by-step example, see the [Controllers Pattern](mountable-controllers.mdx) page.

### Migrating hasChildLithoViews parameter

In MountSpecs, the `hasChildLithoViews` parameter could be added to the @MountSpec annotation to indicate whether a given component mounts views that contain component-based content that can be incrementally mounted (such as if the mounted view has a LithoView with incremental mount enabled).

To implement the equivalent behaviour in Mountable, override the [doesMountRenderTreeHosts()](https://fburl.com/doesmountrendertreehosts) method to return `true`.

<Tabs
  groupId="migrating_from_mountspecs_tab_group"
  defaultValue="mountspec_tab"
  values={[
    {label: 'Mount Spec', value: 'mountspec_tab'},
    {label: 'Mountable', value: 'mountable_tab'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="mountspec_tab">

```java
@MountSpec(hasChildLithoViews = true)
public class MyComponentSpec {
  ...
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="mountable_tab">

```kotlin
class MyMountable : SimpleMountable<View>(RenderType.VIEW) {

 override fun doesMountRenderTreeHosts(): Boolean = true

 ...
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Migrating isPureRender parameter

In MountSpecs, the `isPureRender` parameter could be added to the @MountSpec annotation to indicate whether a given component is pure render - when the ComponentTree for this component is updated, if nothing changes then the measurements for this component can be re-used.

For Mountable, there's no equivalent behaviour as all the Mountable Components are pure render, so when migrating this parameter should be ignored.
