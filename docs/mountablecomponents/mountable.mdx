title: Lifecycle of a SimpleMountable
---

A `Mountable` represents a reusable unit responsible for hosting the logic to create, measure, and mount the content that the mountable component will render.

As illustrated in the [Creating a Mountable Component](mountable-component.mdx#creating-a-mountable-component) page, the `MountableComponent.render()` method should return a `Mountable` implementation and any `Style` object to be applied to the component on the `MountableRenderResult` object.

This page provides an overview of a `SimpleMountable`: a simplified version of a Mountable that can be extended to provide a bespoke implementation.

## Lifecycle of a SimpleMountable

A SimpleMountable has four important stages in its lifecycle, which occur in the following order:

1. [Creation](#creation-of-a-mountable)
1. [Content size measurement](#content-size-measurement)
1. [Content creation](#content-creation)
1. [Mounting and unmounting content properties](#mounting-and-unmounting-content-properties)

Each of these stages is detailed in the following sub-sections.

### Creation of a SimpleMountable

In order to create a SimpleMountable, write a class that extends the [SimpleMountable](https://fburl.com/simplemountable) abstract class.

The following example provides an implementation of `SimpleMountable` with an `ImageView` as content:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/mountables/SimpleImageViewComponent.kt start=start_simple_mountable_example end=end_simple_mountable_example
```

### Content size measurement

:::note
This stage of the SimpleMountable's lifecycle can occur on any thread.
:::

Each SimpleMountable should implement a `measure()` function to define how it measures itself given arbitrary width and height specs. The `MeasureResult` object it returns contains the width and height of the content, and optionally any layout data, as shown in the following example:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/mountables/bindto/ImageViewComponent.kt start=measure_example_start end=measure_example_end
```

To learn about the different strategies to measure content, see the [Measuring](mountable-measuring.mdx) page.

### Content creation

:::note
This stage of the SimpleMountable's lifecycle can only occur on the main thread.
:::

Each SimpleMountable needs to create the content it hosts (either a `View` or a `Drawable`) by a implementing the `createContent()` method, as shown in the following example:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/mountables/bindto/ImageViewComponent.kt start=create_content_example_start end=create_content_example_end
```

You should also pass the type of the created content to the `SimpleMountable` super constructor, either `RenderType.VIEW` for views or `RenderType.DRAWABLE` for drawables.

:::note
The content should not be mutated based on props passed from MountableComponent to the SimpleMountable.
:::

In order to optimize the mount performance, the methods from the `ContentAllocator` interface can also be overridden to define a [content pooling](mountable-preallocation.mdx) strategy.

### Mounting and unmounting content properties

:::note
This stage of the SimpleMountable's lifecycle can only occur on the main thread.
:::

Properties can be set and unset on the content using `mount()` and `unmount()` methods respectively. Additionally, the `shouldUpdate()` can be overridden to decide whether properties need resetting.

The following code shows a component that extends `SimpleMountable` and appropriately sets and unsets the properties on the content:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/mountables/bindto/ImageViewComponent.kt start=mount_unmount_example_start end=mount_unmount_example_end
```

:::note Important
Once set, a property should be unset in the `unmount()` method to ensure correctness when the content is reused.
