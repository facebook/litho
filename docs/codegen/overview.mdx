This section contains information about the old Java Spec API.

For new development, the Kotlin API is recommended. Please refer to the [Components](mainconcepts/components-basics.mdx) page.

In this section, you'll find the following information:

* [Layout Specs](layout-specs.mdx) - the logical equivalents of composite views on Android.
* [Mount Specs](mount-specs.md) - components that can render views or drawables.
* [Props](passing-data-to-components/props.md) and [TreeProps](passing-data-to-components/treeprops.mdx) - the ways you can pass data to Components.
* [State in Specs](state-for-specs.md) - data that is encapsulated and managed within the Component and is transparent to its parent.
* [Events for Specs](events-for-specs.md) - a general-purpose API to connect components with one another.
* [Triggering events with Handles](trigger-events.md) - how to use a `Handle` to trigger Events on components.
* [Code generation](code-generation.mdx) - the mechanism that Litho relies on in order to create *Components* from *Component Specs*.
