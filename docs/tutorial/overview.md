This tutorial doesn’t assume any existing Litho knowledge.

We will build a small Instagram clone during this tutorial.

The tutorial is divided into several sections:
* [Project Setup](project-setup) will help you set up the environment for the rest of the tutorial
* [Component Props](first-components) will introduce core Litho concepts: Components and their Props
* [Adding State](adding-state) will teach you how to make your Components interactive
* [Building Lists](building-lists) will switch to organizing individual Components in Lists

You don’t have to complete all of the sections at once to get the value out of this tutorial. Try to
get as far as you can — even if it’s one or two sections.
