/**
 * The saveable-state registries of a collection's rows.
 *
 * The collection has a registry of its own in the tree's registry, keyed by the collection's
 * component identity, so two lists with the same row ids never compete for a key. Under it, each
 * row key has one registry, shared by every item built for that key: the items a speculative
 * changeset builds for measurement, which may never be committed, read the same registry as the
 * committed row.
 *
 * A row's registry lives as long as the collection, so a row that leaves, scrolled away or removed
 * from the data, keeps its values in memory and gets them back when it is shown again. The
 * collection saves a row while one of its items is bound to a view, and also while none has been
 * since the row's registry was created, as for rows rendered ahead of the viewport or not rendered
 * since a restore. Once its last item is unbound in a mounted collection, the row is left out of
 * the collection's saved state until it is bound again. A registry that holds nothing is closed
 * once its row is neither in the data nor bound, so rows without saveable state leave nothing
 * behind.
 *
 * Rows of one item list with the same key can't be told apart, so from then on every row with that
 * key gets a registry of its own that is not saved, and the values saved for the key are dropped.
 *
 * Items are built and rendered on background threads, and bound and unbound, and their data
 * committed, on the main thread.
 *
 * @param collectionKey the collection's component identity, or `null` if it has none to persist, in
 *   which case its rows are not saved
