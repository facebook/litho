/**
 * Because a LayoutInfo/LayoutManager may rely on padding to generate a child measure specs, and
 * because padding isn't accessible in a thread-safe way, this interface gives a LayoutManager the
 * chance to record the RecyclerView's padding when it's attached.
 *
 * <p>This is a bit of a hack and is best-effort only -- the primary goal is to prevent accessing
 * View padding off the main thread since it can crash. If RV padding changes after this padding
 * info is set, the bg padding info will NOT be up-to-date. For most usecases, this shouldn't
 * matter.
