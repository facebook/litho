/**
 * BinderTreeCollection hide the structure used to operate on ComponentTrees used by the Binder.
 * Right now we are operating on a SparseArray.
 * Shifting the SparseArray left and right is potentially bad. Each call uses a System.arraycopy()
 * this means shiftSparseArrayRight/Left is O(n*m), where n is (sparseArray.size() - fromPosition)
