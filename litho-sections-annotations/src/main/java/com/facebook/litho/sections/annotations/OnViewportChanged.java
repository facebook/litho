/**
 * The method annotated with this annotation will be called when the UI rendering the <code>Section
 * </code> scrolls to a new position.
 *
 * <p>See <a
 * href="https://fblitho.com/docs/communicating-with-the-ui#onviewportchanged">communicating-with-the-ui</a>
 * for details.
 *
 * <p>Example:
 *
 * <pre><code>
 * {@literal @}DiffSectionSpec
 *  public class MyChangeSetSpec {
 *
 *  {@literal @}OnViewportChanged
 *   protected void onViewportChanged(
 *     SectionContext c,
 *     int firstVisiblePosition,
 *     int lastVisiblePosition,
 *     int totalCount, // the total count of items this ListComponent is displaying in the list
 *     int firstFullyVisibleIndex,
 *     int lastFullyVisibleIndex,
 *     Service service) { // If any
 *     if (something(firstVisiblePosition, lastVisiblePosition, totalCount) {
 *       service.doSomething();
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <p>This lifecycle method will only be called if either firstVisiblePosition or
 * lastVisiblePosition have changed in response to a scroll event.
