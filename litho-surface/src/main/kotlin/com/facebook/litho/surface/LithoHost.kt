/**
 * Hosts one root Litho [Component] for an Activity or Fragment: it owns the `ComponentTree` and the
 * [LithoView] that shows it.
 *
 * The tree lives as long as the Activity or Fragment, not its view, so [setContent] can build it in
 * `onCreate()`, before the view exists, and a Fragment keeps its tree, with all of its state, while
 * its view is destroyed and recreated on the back stack. The tree renders once its view is first
 * measured, and is released when the Activity or Fragment is destroyed. `useSaveableState` values
 * come back after recreation and process death; plain `useState` values do not.
 *
 * A Fragment instance can outlive what the host was built with, and the host follows it:
 * - removed and added again, it gets a new Lifecycle from AndroidX, and the host starts over on it;
 * - with `setRetainInstance(true)`, it keeps its instance when its Activity is recreated. The host
 *   releases the tree when the Activity it was built with is destroyed and builds a new one with
 *   the new Activity's Context from the last [setContent] content. Its `useSaveableState` values
 *   carry over; plain `useState` values do not, as on any recreation.
 *
 * Obtain a host with [Fragment.lithoHost] or [ComponentActivity.lithoHost]. Each host is identified
 * by its declaration order within its Activity or Fragment, so declare hosts as unconditional
 * properties and keep their order stable. Declaring one once the owner is created, as in
 * `onCreateView`, is reported: each run creates another host and tree.
