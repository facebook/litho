/**
 * Per-(owner, key) [ViewModel] that owns a Litho [ComponentTree] across the owner's lifetime,
 * including configuration changes. Callers reach this VM via the extension-function API in
 * [LithoSurface] — direct construction is internal.
 *
 * ## Acquisition
 *
 * Two paths:
 * - **Single-surface owners**: call [setLithoContent], [getLithoView], or [bindLithoViewTo] as
 *   extension methods on the receiver. The default-keyed VM is created or reused under the hood.
 * - **Multi-surface owners and containers**: declare a property via the `lithoViewModel(...)`
 *   delegate (fragment / activity) or call `owner.lithoViewModel(...)` as a function (container).
 *   Each call returns this `LithoViewModel`; surface operations are methods on the returned handle.
 *
 * ## Lifetimes
 *
 * The VM is stored in the owner's [androidx.lifecycle.ViewModelStore]. It survives configuration
 * changes (rotation, multi-window resize, etc.); it is cleared by the platform on real teardown
 * (`onCleared`).
 *
 * Within the VM's lifetime, the [ComponentTree] is built and released *per instance lifecycle*:
 * - Built eagerly on the first [setLithoContent] call after construction or after instance
 *   teardown.
 * - Snapshot via [ComponentTree.acquireTreeState] and released when the providing instance owner
 *   reaches `onDestroy`.
 * - Rebuilt on the next [setLithoContent] call (against the new instance owner's
 *   [Context] + [LifecycleOwner]) and seeded with the saved [TreeState] so descendant `useState`,
 *   `@State` containers, and other state survive rotation.
 *
 * ## View binding
 *
 * Within a view-cycle, exactly one [LithoView] is bound — either created lazily by [getLithoView]
 * or supplied by the caller via [bindLithoViewTo]. Calling either method after the other has set
 * the view-cycle's binding throws. The bound view is unbound when the view-cycle owner reaches
 * `onDestroy`.
 *
 * ## Tree props
 *
 * The instance lifecycle owner is wired as the tree's [androidx.lifecycle.LifecycleOwner] tree
 * prop, so descendants using `useLiveData` and lifecycle-aware `useFlow` subscribe correctly. One
 * [LithoSaveableStateRegistry] is retained across tree recreation and snapshotted through Android
 * saved state so descendants using `useSaveableState` can restore after process recreation.
 *
 * ## Side resources
 *
 * Cleanup actions registered via [onSurfaceClose] run in [onCleared] (real teardown), not on
 * rotation. Use them for paired side resources whose lifetime should match the surface — e.g.
 * `GraphQLDataSource.close()`, coroutine `Job.cancel()`.
