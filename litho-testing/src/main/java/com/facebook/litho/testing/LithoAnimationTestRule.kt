/**
 * JUnit rule that installs a deterministic animation frame driver for the duration of a test.
 *
 * This rule keeps [AnimationController] global while giving animation tests explicit control over
 * frame delivery and frame timestamps. [advanceBy] and [advanceTo] advance animation elapsed time:
 * if an animation is scheduled but has not received its first frame yet, the rule first dispatches
 * a frame at the current test time, then advances to the requested time. Tests that need Litho or
 * Robolectric work flushed after each frame can provide [afterFrame], for example
 * `shadowOf(getMainLooper()).idle()`.
