/**
 * A class that is annotated with this annotation will be used to create a component lifecycle that
 * is made up of other components.
 * <p>A class that is annotated with {@link LayoutSpec} must implement a method with the
 * {@link OnCreateLayout} annotation. It may also implement methods with the following annotations:
 * - {@link OnLoadStyle}
 * - {@link OnEvent}
 * <p>If you wish to create a component that mounts its own content, then use {@link MountSpec}
 * instead.
 * <p>For example:
 * <pre>
 * <code>{@literal @}LayoutSpec
 * public class MyComponentSpec {
 *
 *  {@literal @}OnCreateLayout
 *   ComponentLayout onCreateLayout(LayoutContext c, @Prop MyProp prop) {
 *       return Row.create(c)
 *           .alignItems(FLEX_START)
 *           .child(someChild1)
 *           .child(someChild2)
 *           .build();
 *   }
 * }
