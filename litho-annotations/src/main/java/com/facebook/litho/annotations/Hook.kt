/**
 * Marker for the Litho hooks.
 *
 * Carrying this annotation is what makes a function a hook, and it drives both hook rules:
 * `KComponentHookCallsite` requires the call to come from `render()` or another `@Hook` function,
 * and `KComponentHookInDeferredLambda` requires it to run synchronously during render. Neither rule
 * restricts control flow — the compiler plugin gives each call site a structural identity, so hooks
 * may be called in conditions, loops, and after early returns. Two consequences are worth knowing:
 * a hook's state lives exactly as long as the hook keeps being called, so a hook that stops running
 * loses its state and starts from its initial value when it runs again; and repeated invocations of
 * one call site are positional unless wrapped in `withNewScope` with a stable product key. See the
 * Hooks Overview doc.
 *
 * Calling a hook requires opting in, and the only supported way to do that is the `-opt-in`
 * argument that `litho_hook_identity_decorator` emits alongside the Litho compiler plugin. A module
 * that calls a hook from an un-annotated function without the plugin therefore fails to compile
 * instead of throwing on its first render — a compiler plugin cannot detect its own absence, so the
 * always-present annotation has to carry the requirement.
 *
 * Never hand-write the opt-in. `@OptIn(Hook::class)` or a manual `-opt-in` argument silences the
 * requirement without adding the plugin, which is precisely the state this marker exists to
 * prevent. Both are what kotlinc suggests when the requirement fires, which is why [message] spells
 * out the real fix — the diagnostic is the only place the reader is looking.
