/**
 * <strong>EXPERIMENTAL</strong>. This is a part of new experimental API. There is no guarantee that
 * this API will work or that it will remain the same.
 *
 * <p>A method annotation used in {@link MountSpec} classes to indicate methods that apply current
 * value of dynamic prop {@link Prop} to the mounted content.
 *
 * <p>For every dynamic {@link Prop}, ComponentSpec should provide exactly one {@link
 * OnBindDynamicValue} method.
 *
 * <p>Every {@link OnBindDynamicValue} takes two parameters: 1st - mounted content object; 2nd -
 * current value of the dynamic {@link Prop}, which needs to be applied to the mount content.
 *
 * <p>The method should return void.
 *
 * <p>This callback will be invoked when a Component is being bound and after that, every time when
 * value of dynamic {@link Prop} changes until the Component is unbound.
 *
 * @see Prop#dynamic()
