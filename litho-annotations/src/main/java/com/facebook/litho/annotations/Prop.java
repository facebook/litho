/**
 * Inputs to a {@code Component} are its props. The props for a given Component are the union of all
 * arguments annotated with {@code Prop} in your spec methods. The same prop can be defined and
 * accessed in multiple lifecycle methods. The annotation processor will validate that the props are
 * being used with the correct type and name.
 *
 * <p>For each unique prop defined on the spec, the annotation processor add a setter method on the
 * Component's Builder that has the same name as the prop. By default props are required but can be
 * marked as optional. A prop can also be constrained further using by setting it's {@code resType}.
 *
 * <p>The parent component sets the the props when it creates the component in it's {@link
 * OnCreateLayout} method. The props cannot be updated throughout the lifecycle of the component. If
 * the props need to be updated, the parent has to create a new component and set new props. The
 * props <em>should</em> be immutable since the layout can be calculated on multiple threads.
 * Immutability of the props ensures that no thread safety issues can occur in the component
 * hierarchy.
 *
 * <p><b>Creating Props:</b> <br>
 *
 * <pre><code>{@literal @LayoutSpec}
 * public class HeaderSpec {
 *
 *  {@literal @OnCreateLayout}
 *   static Component onCreateLayout(
 *     ComponentContext c,
 *    {@literal @Prop} MyTitles title,
 *    {@literal @Prop} String imageUrl,
 *    {@literal @Prop(optional = true)} boolean isSelected) {
 *
 *     return Column.create(c)
 *       .paddingDip(YogaEdge.ALL, 8)
 *       .backgroundColor(isSelected ? Color.WHITE : Color.GREEN)
 *       .child(
 *         Image.create(c)
 *           .url(imageUrl)
 *           .marginDip(YogaEdge.BOTTOM, 4)
 *       )
 *       .child(
 *         Text.create(c)
 *           .text(title.getTitle())
 *           .textSizeSp(16)
 *           .marginDip(YogaEdge.BOTTOM, 4)
 *       )
 *       .child(
 *         Text.create(c)
 *           .text(title.getSubtitle())
 *           .textSizeSp(12)
 *       )
 *       .build();
 *   }
 * }</code></pre>
 *
 * <p>Notice how {@code imageUrl}, {@code title} and {@code isSelected} are used to set properties
 * on different components within the layout.
 *
