/**
 * A Litho collection item with lazy data fetching and a content key for update detection.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * LithoCollectionItem(
 *   context = context,
 *   dataProvider = { getStoryData(storyId) },
 *   component = { data -> StoryCardComponent(data) },
 *   sizeConstraints = sizeConstraints,
 *   traceTag = "StoryCard",
 *   // Optional: rebuild only when a rendered field changes
 *   contentKey = { data -> data.title to data.likeCount },
 * )
 * ```
 *
 * ## Thread Safety
 * - [prepare] and [unprepare]: Any thread
 * - [bind] and [unbind]: Main thread only
 *
 * ## Release while shown
 * With [keepTreeWhileShown], an item its owner releases while it is bound keeps the tree its view
 * shows, for instance when an asynchronous worker runs a release chosen before the row scrolled
 * back and bound again; releasing the tree then would blank that view. The tree is released on
 * [unbind] instead, as is a tree a [bind] builds after the release. So a consumer that turns this
 * on must unbind every view it binds; a view it leaves bound keeps its tree. Without it,
 * [unprepare] releases the tree whether or not a view shows it.
 *
 * @param T The data type. Supports nullable types for placeholder states.
 * @param context Android context for component creation.
 * @param dataProvider Provides data when called. Invoked lazily during preparation.
 * @param component Creates a Component from the data.
 * @param sizeConstraints Fixed size constraints for layout. Used when [sizeConstraintsProvider] is
 *   null.
 * @param contentKey What [component] depends on in the data, compared with `equals`. Recorded when
 *   the component is built; the component is rebuilt when the current data's key differs, and
 *   otherwise kept (and, with a [sizeConstraintsProvider], laid out at the current data's
 *   constraints). Not the row's identity: a key that stays the same while rendered fields change
 *   keeps a stale component. Defaults to the data itself, which suits value data; data compared by
 *   identity or mutated in place needs an explicit key.
 * @param findLithoView Locates the LithoView within a container view.
 * @param onAfterBind Optional callback invoked after bind completes. Receives the bound LithoView.
 *   Called on the main thread.
 * @param onAfterUnbind Optional callback invoked before unbind clears the view. Receives the
 *   LithoView. Called on the main thread.
 * @param treeConfigurator Optional hook to customize the [ComponentTree.Builder] before the tree is
 *   built. This is the single place to set a custom
 *   [com.facebook.litho.config.ComponentsConfiguration] (via `componentsConfiguration(...)`),
 *   attach a visibility events controller, a lifecycle-owner tree prop, etc. Invoked once per tree
 *   build. When null (default), the tree uses the ComponentContext's default configuration. Kept
 *   generic so this base library stays free of app-layer lifecycle/visibility dependencies.
 * @param keepTreeWhileShown whether a bound item's tree survives [unprepare] until [unbind] (see
 *   "Release while shown"). Off by default, so each consumer turns it on behind its own config.
 * @param sizeConstraintsProvider Optional current constraints for a data snapshot. Setting it opts
 *   the item into re-laying out a kept tree when constraints change, and into leaving a shown
 *   tree's size to its LithoView; without it, the item keeps its fixed-constraint behavior. Invoked
 *   on the thread preparing or binding the item, so it must be cheap and thread-safe.
