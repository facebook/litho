Litho provides a variety of tools to write different types of tests. This page provides
a brief overview of them.

## Unit Testing

Litho provides a suite of helpers to make unit testing easier. Learn about the
setup with our JUnit Rules and AssertJ helpers in [Unit Testing Basics](unit-testing).

* [**Sub-Component Testing**](subcomponent-testing): A common way to test components
is by testing assertions on the component hierarchy; *i.e. find components that are
expected to be present or absent in the component tree*. The sub-component APIs provide
utilities method to easily write such tests.

* **Prop Matching**: Provides APIs to write tests for asserting the prop
values set on the components in the hierarchy.
  * [**Matching @Prop**](prop-matching)
  * [**Matching @InjectProp**](injectprop-matching)
  * [**Matching @TreeProp**](testing-treeprops)
  * [**EventHandler Testing**](event-handler-testing)

* [**Section Testing**](sections-testing): Section hierarchies can be tested similarly
using the SectionComponentTestHelper and SubSection APIs.
