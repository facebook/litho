import {VersionedCodeBlock} from './../versionedCodeBlock';
export const testingDependenciesCode = `testImplementation 'com.facebook.litho:litho-testing:{{site.lithoVersion}}'`;

In order to use any of the testing utilities please include the `litho-testing` package in the
build. Add the following lines to the `dependencies` block in the `build.gradle` file:

<VersionedCodeBlock language="groovy" code={testingDependenciesCode} />

Litho's testing APIs are exposed through fluid AssertJ methods. They are available as:

*  [ComponentAssert](pathname:///javadoc/com/facebook/litho/testing/assertj/ComponentAssert.html)
for assertions that are run against either Component builders or Components.
* [LithoViewAssert](pathname:///javadoc/com/facebook/litho/testing/assertj/LithoViewAssert.html)
for assertions against mounted UI hierarchies.

For convenience, [LithoAssertions.assertThat](pathname:///javadoc/com/facebook/litho/testing/assertj/LithoAssertions.html)
can be statically imported. It hosts all the APIs of `ComponentAssert`, and `LithoViewAssert`.

```java
import static com.facebook.litho.testing.assertj.LithoAssertions.assertThat;
```

## Example

To demonstrate the usage of these APIs consider the following component that displays a like icon and
a short description.

```java
/**
 * Displays who liked the post.
 *
 * 1 - 3 likers => Comma separated names (e.g. Jane, Mike, Doug)
 * > 3 likers => Comma separated number denoting the like count
 */
@LayoutSpec
class LikersComponentSpec {

  @OnCreateLayout
  protected static Component onCreateLayout(
      ComponentContext c,
      @Prop List<User> likers) {

    return Row.create(c)
        .alignItems(FLEX_START)
        .child(
          Image.create(c)
            .drawableRes(R.drawable.like))
        .child(
          Text.create(c)
            .text(formatLikers(likers))
            .textSizeSp(12)
            .ellipsize(TruncateAt.END))
        .build();
  }

  private static String formatLikers(List<User> likers) {
    ...
  }
}
```

## Setup

To verify the rendering of the text and the icon.

* Create a new test class; `LikersComponentTest`.
* Add `@RunWith(RobolectricTestRunner.class)` to the top of the test class.
* Add a `LithoViewRule` JUnit [`@Rule`](https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Rules) which
sets up overrides for [Styleables](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.styleable.html)
and exposes some useful APIs.

The test class should look like the following:

```java
@RunWith(RobolectricTestRunner.class)
public class LikersComponentTest {

  public final @Rule LithoViewRule mLithoViewRule = new LithoViewRule();

}
```

## Testing component rendering

`LithoAssertions` exposes AssertJ-style APIs to assert what get rendered by a component. These APIs
will generally layout, mount and render the component before testing the assertions.

```java
@RunWith(RobolectricTestRunner.class)
public class LikersComponentTest {

  public final @Rule LithoViewRule mLithoViewRule = new LithoViewRule();
  @Test
  public void whenTwoUsersLike_shouldShowBothUserNames() {
    final ComponentContext c = mLithoViewRule.getContext();
    final ImmutableList<User> likers = ImmutableList.of(
      new User("Jane"), new User("Mike")
    );
    final LikersComponent component = LikersComponent.create(c)
        .likers(likers)
        .build();

    LithoAssertions.assertThat(c , component).hasVisibleText("Jane, Mike");
  }

  @Test
  public void whenUsersLike_shouldShowLikeIcon() {
    final ComponentContext c = mLithoViewRule.getContext();
    final ImmutableList<User> likers = ImmutableList.of(
      new User("Jane"), new User("Mike")
    );
    final LikersComponent component = LikersComponent.create(c)
        .likers(likers)
        .build();

    final Drawable likeIcon = c.getResources().getDrawable(R.drawable.like);
    LithoAssertions.assertThat(c , component).hasVisibleDrawable(likeIcon);
  }
}
```

## Additional assertions

There are several more assertions that can be tested using LithoAssertions. To see the entire
APIs please checkout its [JavaDoc here](pathname:///javadoc/com/facebook/litho/testing/assertj/LithoAssertions.html).
These APIs test assertions on the view heirarchy created by the mounted Component. So asserting
the presence of a Drawable in a Component will traverse the entire view hierarchy rendered by
the Component. Following are some of the assertions provided by LithoAssertions:

* `LithoAssertions#hasVisibleTextMatching()`
* `LithoAssertions#doesNotHaveVisibleText()`
* `LithoAssertions#willRender()`
* `LithoAssertions#doesNotHaveVisibleDrawable()`
* `LithoAssertions#hasContentDescription()`
* `LithoAssertions#willNotRender()`

:::info
When running Litho unit tests, be aware that the native library for Yoga must be loaded
which can pose some challenges depending on your build system of choice. With Gradle and
Robolectric, for instance, you may run into issues as Robolectric spins up new
[ClassLoaders](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/ClassLoader.html)
for every test suite with a different configuration. The same goes for PowerMock, which
prepares the ClassLoaders on a per-suite basis and leaves them in a non-reusable state.

The JVM has two important limitations that are relevant to this:

1. A shared library can only ever be loaded once per process.
2. `ClassLoader`s do not share information about the libraries loaded.

Because of that, using multiple ClassLoaders for test runs is highly problematic
as every instance will attempt to load Yoga and every but the first will fail with
`libyoga.so already loaded in another classloader` exception.

The only way to avoid this is by either preventing the use of multiple ClassLoaders
or forking the process whenever a new ClassLoader is necessary.

Gradle allows you to limit the number of test classes a process can execute before
it is discarded. If you set the number to one, we avoid the ClassLoader reuse:

```groovy
android {
    [...]

    testOptions {
        unitTests.all {
            forkEvery = 1
            maxParallelForks = Math.ceil(Runtime.runtime.availableProcessors() * 1.5)
        }
    }
}
```

With Buck, this behavior can be achieved by assigning test targets separate names
as those will result in a parallel process being spun up. Alternatively, you can
set the `fork_mode` to `per_test` as described
[here](https://buckbuild.com/rule/java_test.html#fork_mode).

Ultimately, depending on your build system and the existing constraints of your
project, you may need to adjust the way in which your test runner utilizes
ClassLoaders. This is, however, not a problem unique to Litho but an unfortunate
consequence of mixing native and Java code in Android projects.
