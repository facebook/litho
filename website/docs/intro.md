Litho is a declarative framework for building efficient user interfaces (UI) on
Android. It allows you to write highly-optimized Android views through a simple
functional API based on Java annotations. It was [primarily built](uses)
to implement complex scrollable UIs based on RecyclerView.

With Litho, you build your UI in terms of *components* instead of interacting
directly with traditional Android views. A *component* is essentially a
function that takes immutable inputs, called *props*, and returns a component
hierarchy describing your user interface.

```java
@LayoutSpec
class HelloComponentSpec {

  @OnCreateLayout
  static Component onCreateLayout(
      ComponentContext c,
      @Prop String name) {

    return Text.create(c)
        .text("Hello, " + name)
        .textSizeRes(R.dimen.my_text_size)
        .textColor(Color.BLACK)
        .paddingDip(ALL, 10)
        .build();
  }
}
```

You simply declare what you want to display and Litho takes care of rendering
it in the most efficient way by computing [layout in a background
thread](asynchronous-layout), automatically [flattening your view
hierarchy](view-flattening), and [incrementally
rendering](inc-mount-architecture) complex components.
